### 2020 food observations

![Top 20 foods of 2020 by calories](top20foods_2020_table.png)

-   11 of the foods are “snacky”, 7 foods are “mealy”, and 2 foods are desert
-   Looks like on average when I ate B&J I would eat a whole pints worth

### Take-aways

-   Will try to cut out the B&J and get back into cooking (I think bulk cooking will help with this!)
