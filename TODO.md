# TODOs
* Add a “trend” line to weight + calories + protein graph
* Implement subscribe
* Add a streaks visualization for water
* Add a "tips" drawer in the top-right corner with some legend info on the emojis and info about keyboard shortcuts (make this for web first and then think about mobile)

# Future
* Reach out to BiteSnap developers (looks like feedback function is broken) to share bug (data export issue on images) and share your bitelog. (I believe the developer is Michal Wolski)
