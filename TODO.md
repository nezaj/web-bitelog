# TODOs
* Implement grouping meals/snacks
* Add a “trend” line to weight + calories + protein graph
* Implement subscribe
* Add a streaks visualization for water

# Future
* Reach out to BiteSnap developers (looks like feedback function is broken) to share bug (data export issue on images) and share your bitelog. (I believe the developer is Michal Wolski)
