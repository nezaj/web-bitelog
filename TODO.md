# TODOs
* Add a "subscribe" feature to email a daily/weekly digest
* Add trends for water, weight, and eating windows (may want to think about the UI for this!)

# Future
* Reach out to BiteSnap developers (looks like feedback function is broken) to share bug (data export issue on images) and share your bitelog. (I believe the developer is Michal Wolski)
