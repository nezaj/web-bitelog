# TODOs
* Add a weekday (y val) vs date (x val) dot chart with calorie amounts to visual calories for weekdays over time
* Add a weekday (y val) vs hour (x val) dot chart with calorie amounts to visual calories eaten over hours in the day (make this work with your big number filters)
* Add a streaks visualization for water
* Implement subscribe
* Add a "tips" drawer in the top-right corner with some legend info on the emojis and info about keyboard shortcuts (make this for web first and then think about mobile)

# Future
* Reach out to BiteSnap developers (looks like feedback function is broken) to share bug (data export issue on images) and share your bitelog. (I believe the developer is Michal Wolski)
