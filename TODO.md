# TODOs
* Implement design spec!
    * Implement navigation
        * Add conditional routing (no need for react-router IMO)
        * Add conditional styling based on current route
    * Add trend graphs
* Enable ad-hoc / non-app data entry

# Future
* Think about what could "break" and how to handle it best
* Think about perf improvements
