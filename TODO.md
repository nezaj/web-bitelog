# TODOs

    * Support gestures
    * Support keyboard shortcuts (left, right, x/escape)
* Add an about page
* Add water tracking

# Future
* Think about what could "break" and how to handle it best
* Think about perf improvements
    * Keep initial age page <5MB (or even better <1MB)
    * Re-size and crop avatar (this is def bigger than needs to be)
    * Re-size food images
    * Add pagination
* Reach out to BiteSnap developers (looks like feedback function is broken) to share bug (data export issue on images) and share your bitelog. (I believe the developer is Michal Wolski)
