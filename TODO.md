# TODOs
* Add legend (Inform about clicking picture to enlarge / keyboard shortcuts / swiping)
* Add about page
* Implement subscribe

# Future
* Generalize / write generator for JoeLogs (maybe create a tutorial for how to use it)
* Reach out to BiteSnap developers (looks like feedback function is broken) to share bug (data export issue on images) and share your bitelog. (I believe the developer is Michal Wolski)
