# TODOs
* Think about perf improvements (get initial app page <1MB)
    * Re-size food images
* Implement image detail view
    * Re-factor modal so it can gracefull handle desktop/landscape mode (maybe look up tutorial on implementing FB/Insta style modal)
    * Support gestures
    * Support keyboard shortcuts (left, right, x/escape)
* Add water tracking
* Add weight tracking

# Future
* Think about what could "break" and how to handle it best
* Reach out to BiteSnap developers (looks like feedback function is broken) to share bug (data export issue on images) and share your bitelog. (I believe the developer is Michal Wolski)

### Bugs
* Why does date stamp appeared as undefined on Grandma's iPad?
