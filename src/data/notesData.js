module.exports = { notesData: {"9/22/2020":"Cut my thumb today while prepping food for cooking :( -- nothing serious but\nan inconvenience!\n\nOtherwise good day all around :)","9/20/2020":"Hosted guests this weekend and definitely did not eat as healthy! One thing I've\nbeen noticing more and more is that eating things like cake / cheat foods is just\nnot worth it. The satisfaction I get from them is vastly lower than before and\nI know I need to make up for it the following days. This is making me want junk\nless and less.\n\nOn the up-side, compared to previous excess days, this weekend was far lower than\nusual. I definitely feel like the diet is iterating towards getting cleaner and\ncleaner :)","9/13/2020":"Fast day!","9/12/2020":"Housewarming and bday celebration last night! Very very fun! We had three different cakes!! Lots\nof treats too. Knew today was gonna be a big one in terms of calories. Will make\nup for the excess on Sunday.","9/7/2020":"Solid day. Love how doing the simple things makes the rest of the day feel good :)","9/6/2020":"Very social weekend! Calories were def over. Started dating again and realize\nthat I don't want to do the whole alcohol + food thing. Un-neccesary calories,\ndrunchies, and feeling sluggish the next day is no fun. Already updated my\nprofiles to reflect the distate for alcohol :)","9/4/2020":"Made shrimp for the first time yesterday! Came out pretty good. Had leftovers\nso finished them up today. One thing I've noticed is when I have bigger meals\n(like today breakfast was bigger) I feel sluggish after and then have hunger\ncravings sooner (maybe it's because I have less focus -> giving into distraction)\nWill try having \"meals\" not be as large","9/2/2020":"We back on track :)","9/1/2020":"Solid day! Back on the groceries life :)","8/31/2020":"Another off day in terms of diet -- but now we have proper groceries! Will be\nback on tracking tomorrow :)","8/30/2020":"Oof, went overboard on the calories today. We were moving today so wasn't able\nto really eat properly. Had a small brunch and then worked at a cafe for the\nafternoon until dinner. After dinner just had some sugar cravings and gave in.\nI think I'll not worry about making up for excess calories last two days and try\nto get back to normal. May start doing pro-active fasts later this week to build\nup caloric deficencies ahead of time as a buffer for dinners with friends. This\nway I don't need to correct in a reactive way","8/29/2020":"Bit of sporadic day, eating times were far spread apart which definitely lead\nto more calories, but oh well!","8/28/2020":"Half-fast today! Making up for previous day excess. One thing that's definitely\nnice about the logging is it makes excess / defciences very visible. This\nenables action. Like in this case since I over-ate yesterday will \"under-eat\" a\nbit today and continue as normal tomorrow!","8/27/2020":"Had some Ethopian food with friends tonight. Sooooo yummy. Calories were definitely\nover but oh well. Can make it up tomorrow","8/26/2020":"Another chill day. Energy levels felt good, workout felt good. Reading-filled day :)","8/25/2020":"Chill day. Made eggs again today, so yummy. Makes me think more and more about\nbeing meal-centric. Perhaps I can work towards doing something like eggs in AM,\ndeli-wrap for lunch, and then proper dinner. It is nice to snack a bit mid day\nas a break between work and for re-fueling. But perhaps with more meal-centric\nfood will have less need to snack","8/24/2020":"Another day of 2x workouts! Energy felt good for most of day. Home cooking / good\nmacros makes a difference!","8/23/2020":"Dinner was delicious. Tried cooking the tomatoes and cucumbers with the chicken\nand frozen veggies. Came out wonderful. There's something I really enjoy about\nhome cooking.\n\nOverall productive day. Lots of reading and 2x workouts (3+ hours total!)","8/22/2020":"Lower energy day. Tried getting through trevor's workout but was feeling tired.\nLikely due to the fasting from previous day + lots of hookah (almost every other\nday for the last few weeks now). Will start limiting smoking amount","8/21/2020":"Fasted for most of the day to make up for excess calories! Had decent energy\nthroughout the day and even got in two workouts! Was definitely tempted to eat\nin the evening but managed to stay strong!","8/20/2020":"Another big calorie day. Walked/biked all over NYC apartment hunting. Got some\nyummy NYC staples. Street food, shake shack, and local gelato, nom nom","8/16/2020":"Lots of calories today! Had an epic dinner with some friends. Definitely went overboard but oh well, I enjoyed it :)","8/15/2020":"Action packed day! 7mi bike ride, 10k steps from exploring, and jiu-jitsu in the\nevening. Visited my sis and her bf and had lunch and sweets together. Happy to\nbe keeping calories in check","8/12/2020":"Noticed I've been snacking more lately and especially eating lots of the chocolate\nalmonds. Will try to get more meal centric. Trevor had a good suggestion to get\na water jug too -- I think this is a good idea for hitting the 8 cups / water a\nday goal.\n\nNew feature added too -- now including trend data for weight!","8/11/2020":"Stayed up a bit late last night so was a bit lower energy. However\nfinished up Export Health! with Stopa which felt great. Got some Jiu Jitsu in\nthe evening as well. Calories came in a bit lower today and honestly could\nfeel it in my workout. I remarked on this yesterday but yea, I want to be\nmore on top of drinking water. I'm also trying to incoporate more stretching\nand new foods recommended by Trevor.\n\nI guess there's a been a lot of new stuff incoporated lately. Hanging with people\nmore, eating out more often, running outside, training Jiu-Jitsu, stretching. Doing\nlots of new things can feel like a chore, so maybe if I'm feeling like it's getting\ntoo annoying I can cut back on something (maybe replace some workouts with stretch + runs?).\nWill feel this out.\n\nOverall though solid day, really proud of Export Health!, happy to be doing\nJiu-Jitsu again, and happy to be eating clean.","8/10/2020":"After a culinary weekend back to some home cooking. Felt nice to home food again.\nNoticed I haven't been as good about drinking 8 cups of water last week. Will try\nto be on top of this up again -- I really do think the extra water = extra energy","8/9/2020":"Met up with some friends in the evening and had some yummy dinner!","8/8/2020":"Today was a full-day hang! Met up with a buddy Jon for some delicious Goergian food\nand NYC roaming followed by Jiu-Jitsu and homemade tacos with our buddy Jan. Fun day!","8/7/2020":"Was working most of day and didn't make time for proper meals so did more snacking. Kept the snacking\nthough mostly protein/fats related. In the evening went out with friends for Thai food!","8/4/2020":"2nd day of freedom! Had some K-BBQ w/ friends. Still a bit excess on calories, but\nensured to plan better for going out. Also, first run today, felt amazing","8/3/2020":"First day of freedom! Got to meet up with some friends and have some street foods!\nCalories definitely added up, but wow >20k steps from all the exploring :)","8/2/2020":"Was a bit lower energy today so caloried up. Was low calories yesterday so balances yet. Excited to go exploring tomorrow!","8/1/2020":"Made a few tweaks to the site! Added water and weight tracking to entries.\nTwo weeks ago I also added swiping (left/right) on mobile when previewing\nentries and keyboard shortcuts (left/right/esc/x) on desktop.","7/19/2020":"Today was a travel day and make-up for yesterday's excess!","7/18/2020":"Another huge calorie day. Was hanging/celebrating with friends. Ate ~2400cals\nalone from snacking in the evening. Had I reigned this in, would have been within\ncalorie targets across the two days\n\nCelebrating is good, but gotta be more on top of excess in these situations!","7/17/2020":"Mini fast in the evening to prepare for a magic evening!","7/15/2020":"Ended up fasting almost the entire day to make up for the excess intake the\nprevious day. Was over-full for most of the day so this was easy to do. Felt\nmuch better after going on a run. Ate a few dates before doing a second workout.\nFelt great by end of day. Back to regular eating tomorrow!","7/14/2020":"Calories were wayyy overboard today.\n\nHad late dinner with friends which resulted in going over 2000 calories target.\nCalorie total was only around 2250 though so not a huge amount over initially.\nHowever I ended up \"tilting\" and going \"all out\" afterwards. No bueno. Will keep\nin mind that just because I went a little over doesn't mean I should tilt."} };
