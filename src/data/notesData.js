module.exports = { notesData: {"8/21/2020":"Fasted for most of the day to make up for excess calories! Had decent energy\nthroughout the day and even got in two workouts! Was definitely tempted to eat\nin the evening but managed to stay strong!","8/20/2020":"Another big calorie day. Walked/biked all over NYC apartment hunting. Got some\nyummy NYC staples. Street food, shake shack, and local gelato, nom nom","8/16/2020":"Lots of calories today! Had an epic dinner with some friends. Definitely went overboard but oh well, I enjoyed it :)","8/15/2020":"Action packed day! 7mi bike ride, 10k steps from exploring, and jiu-jitsu in the\nevening. Visited my sis and her bf and had lunch and sweets together. Happy to\nbe keeping calories in check","8/12/2020":"Noticed I've been snacking more lately and especially eating lots of the chocolate\nalmonds. Will try to get more meal centric. Trevor had a good suggestion to get\na water jug too -- I think this is a good idea for hitting the 8 cups / water a\nday goal.\n\nNew feature added too -- now including trend data for weight!","8/11/2020":"Stayed up a bit late last night so was a bit lower energy. However\nfinished up Export Health! with Stopa which felt great. Got some Jiu Jitsu in\nthe evening as well. Calories came in a bit lower today and honestly could\nfeel it in my workout. I remarked on this yesterday but yea, I want to be\nmore on top of drinking water. I'm also trying to incoporate more stretching\nand new foods recommended by Trevor.\n\nI guess there's a been a lot of new stuff incoporated lately. Hanging with people\nmore, eating out more often, running outside, training Jiu-Jitsu, stretching. Doing\nlots of new things can feel like a chore, so maybe if I'm feeling like it's getting\ntoo annoying I can cut back on something (maybe replace some workouts with stretch + runs?).\nWill feel this out.\n\nOverall though solid day, really proud of Export Health!, happy to be doing\nJiu-Jitsu again, and happy to be eating clean.","8/10/2020":"After a culinary weekend back to some home cooking. Felt nice to home food again.\nNoticed I haven't been as good about drinking 8 cups of water last week. Will try\nto be on top of this up again -- I really do think the extra water = extra energy","8/9/2020":"Met up with some friends in the evening and had some yummy dinner!","8/8/2020":"Today was a full-day hang! Met up with a buddy Jon for some delicious Goergian food\nand NYC roaming followed by Jiu-Jitsu and homemade tacos with our buddy Jan. Fun day!","8/7/2020":"Was working most of day and didn't make time for proper meals so did more snacking. Kept the snacking\nthough mostly protein/fats related. In the evening went out with friends for Thai food!","8/4/2020":"2nd day of freedom! Had some K-BBQ w/ friends. Still a bit excess on calories, but\nensured to plan better for going out. Also, first run today, felt amazing","8/3/2020":"First day of freedom! Got to meet up with some friends and have some street foods!\nCalories definitely added up, but wow >20k steps from all the exploring :)","8/2/2020":"Was a bit lower energy today so caloried up. Was low calories yesterday so balances yet. Excited to go exploring tomorrow!","8/1/2020":"Made a few tweaks to the site! Added water and weight tracking to entries.\nTwo weeks ago I also added swiping (left/right) on mobile when previewing\nentries and keyboard shortcuts (left/right/esc/x) on desktop.","7/19/2020":"Today was a travel day and make-up for yesterday's excess!","7/18/2020":"Another huge calorie day. Was hanging/celebrating with friends. Ate ~2400cals\nalone from snacking in the evening. Had I reigned this in, would have been within\ncalorie targets across the two days\n\nCelebrating is good, but gotta be more on top of excess in these situations!","7/17/2020":"Mini fast in the evening to prepare for a magic evening!","7/15/2020":"Ended up fasting almost the entire day to make up for the excess intake the\nprevious day. Was over-full for most of the day so this was easy to do. Felt\nmuch better after going on a run. Ate a few dates before doing a second workout.\nFelt great by end of day. Back to regular eating tomorrow!","7/14/2020":"Calories were wayyy overboard today.\n\nHad late dinner with friends which resulted in going over 2000 calories target.\nCalorie total was only around 2250 though so not a huge amount over initially.\nHowever I ended up \"tilting\" and going \"all out\" afterwards. No bueno. Will keep\nin mind that just because I went a little over doesn't mean I should tilt."} };
