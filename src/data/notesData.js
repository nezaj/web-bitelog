module.exports = { notesData: {"7/4/2021":"This week started off strong, but went off the rails over the weekend. Averaged 2358cals per day, and carbs came out to 300g due to weekend excess. I'm definitely feeling the bloat as I write this. We had a friend bring candy from Israel on Thursday evening and that set in motion a series of excess decisions. Friday night I went to a friends party and also over-indulged into the hunger. I honestly let myself go, and I think if I came in with a plan for both evenings I would have done better.\n\nMonday -> Thursday were pretty clean, but was definitely getting hungry on Thursday. My weight was dropping a ton too, getting as low as 143.4lb. My weekly average weight came out to 145.1lb, which is a 1.5lb drop from last week. This include the heavier weigh-ins on Saturday and Sunday following the excess days. So although some poor decisions were made, I should be on track for the six pack. Will do better next week!\n\nExercise-wise 3x Lifting, 2x Cardio, 1x BJJ/Judo. Was definitely a bummer that I didn't get to fit more training. Was busy with work and social activities and had to skip classes. I started using FitnessAI for lifting at the gym and it's been great. Takes all the hassle out of planning / recording workouts. The app itself feels fun, and I look forward to the workouts. On Saturday and Sunday I did 2x cardio to help make up for the nights beforehand. I think doing more exercise to help offset extra calories is a good strategy for me.\n\nGoal for next week: Let's get 7/7 green days!","6/27/2021":"This was a great week. Averaged 1983cals/day and macros were on point. All seven days were green days despite eating out twice. Planning ahead made a big difference, by knowing ahead of time I was eating out I was able to budget calories appropriately. For the days I ate in, eating two snapkitchens a day (with fruit + protein) and a protein shake has fulfilled my calorie/macro targets and kept me satiated.\n\nMost of the days where I ate in two meals of snapkitchen with fruit and protein (yogurt or eggs) and a third meal of a protein shake.\n\nExercise-wise 3x Lifting/Judo, 2x Jiu-Jitsu. Little bit less than last week, and only 6/7 days exercised. This was mainly due to increased amount of work this week. It's been very exciting launching Consistent and the reality is it's been a bit harder to fit the workouts in. At the same time my body may have needed the rest. Overall though I love the volume of workouts I'm doing and want to do more. I even made an \"ideal\" schedule this week outlining 4x Lift, 3x Judo, 3x Gi BJJ, 3x No-Gi BJJ, 1x Yoga. This may not be realistic week over week, but aiming for it seem pretty fun.\n\nEver since we started working on Consistent my fitness has much more on-point. The data speaks for itself, this week I logged both my lowest weight since starting joelogs over a year ago, weighing in at 144.4lb twice this week, and my lowest average weekly weight at 146.5lb. My bodyfat scale put me at 13.5%, crossing below the 14% bodyfat threshold for my first time in years.\n\nGoal for next week is to basically repeat my performance this week. And for myself try to fit in some more BJJ!","6/20/2021":"Overall would say this was a solid week. Calories averaged higher, 2351, but this was mainly due to one day of excess calories. This was the day when we had guests with us and we are out twice and had snacks afterwards.\n\nThe rest of the week I was able to stay green while having other social events. I’m doing a better job of planning ahead and making healthier choices with social events. Will try to keep this up in the coming weeks!\n\nExercise-wise was more than last two weeks, 4x BJJ, 2x Judo/Lifting/Yoga. Exercised 7/7 of the days!\n\nWeight-wise logged my lowest average weight to date — 147.1lb\n\nOne thing I notice is that by not “making up” for the excess of one day it makes it easier to be consistent for the others. Instead of yo-yoing between red/blue, staying green keeps me sharp and in a good mood. This does mean my weekly average suffers, but if I can focus on making good choices on a daily basis, and coming to peace with off days, I think this will be better for long term success.\n\nOnwards!","6/18/2021":"Late review! This has been happening more often than not lately. Will try to be mindful and ensure to do these reviews on time by Sunday/Monday going forward!\n\nI logged 6/7 days for an average of 1894cals per day. Exercise-wise was a lighter week with 2x Judo/Lift, 1x Jiu-Jitsu/Run. This was mainly due to having more social activities and YC interview early in the week taking up my evening workout time. Should be back to normal workout schedule next week. I was much better about avoiding excess calories with social eating this week! Had dinner with a friend on Wednesday and a party on Saturday but was able to stay within calorie budget. We also had friends staying with us starting from Sunday where I didn't log but calories weren't too bad. Weight-wise this was my lowest average for the week since I started tracking -- 149lbs!\n\nOverall I feel like I'm making great progress. To do even better, I want to be mindful and not lose my consistency with some habits. I wasn't 7/7 logging or on-time with my review two weeks in a row. Let's change that!","6/6/2021":"Averaged 2027cals last week, but only logged for 5/7 days. This is because I visited family in Boston for a big celebration on the weekend, and didn't bother to log. I indulged in BBQ and cake and definitely overdid it a bit. I realize I associate excess eating with family but it doesn't have to be this way. Next time I go to a family event I'll be more mindful about how I would normally eat and try to replicate that.\n\nFor the rest of the days I ate really clean and consistent. A big motivator is that Stopa and I want to make our startup around getting people six packs. From my own attempts so far, I know for sure being consistent in making good eating choices would make the biggest difference for me. I could be better about exercise and sleep, but honestly, if I didn't indulge in the late night treats and the excess eating with friends / family I would have achieved this a long time ago. Doing this startup is extra motivation.\n\nAnother thing that really helped this week is using a fasting timer app. The app I'm using itself isn't great, but what's nice is that it makes me more mindful each day when I start and stop eating. I start the timer after having my last planned calories for the day. On pressing the button, I'm making a comittment to not eat any more calories until the next morning. When I do press the button to begin the next day it feels rewarding. Now if I want to grab some food at night, I have a little added friction in that I must stop my timer. This alone has been pretty effective so far in not making indulge. I didn't even need to reach out for my SOS app.\n\nWorkout wise it was a lighter week. 2x BJJ/Lift and 1x Judo. No running. The less workouts was mostly due to us fleshing out the idea and prepping for our YC interview. Will still be pushing hard on YC stuff next week, but should be back to normal workout the week after.\n\nOverall ate clean during the week, didn't log during the weekend but that should be a one-off, next time will be more mindful about eating with family (although the damage wasn't too bad). Working on Consistent is definitely a big motivator for the six-pack so super excited for the upcoming weeks!","5/30/2021":"This week was an improvement over last week. Averaged 2345cals, 3x lifting, 2x BJJ/Jduo/Running. My calories were still over my target, but overall I felt much more stable this week.\n\nI had two red days due to social events. I still need to be better about that. One difference this week is that I didn't try as hard to \"make up\" for my excess eating. This made me feel more stable throughout the week and gave me good energy for my workouts.\n\nThis was also the first week I lifted 3x in awhile. Made me realize I need to get back on the daily lifting. Although it's been nice to focus on BJJ/Judo, I've seen lots of skill improvements, I think I want to go back to focusing more on physique. For this week Stopa and I are gonna be focusing on YC interview so will not start daily workouts yet, but will keep this in mind.\n\nFor next week will shoot to keep calories below 2100 average. I also want at least 5 green days again. Let's do this!","5/26/2021":"Last week was ruff as well. Averaged 2570cals, 2x of BJJ+Judo+Lifting, 1x Running. Was still recovering a bit for sickness and back to 100% on Wednesday. We had people over on Tuesday which lead to major overage and then I just let myself go on the weekend. I had two weigh-ins at 150.2 and 151.2 -- so weight is drifting up again!!\n\nAs I'm writing this reflection for last week on Wednesday, I notice I have again eaten excess calories when having friends over (yesterday). I think in general I'm being too lax with the diet. As I'm now starting week 9 of 20 of my six pack goal, it's really time to get serious again","5/17/2021":"This was a tough week, was sick from Wednesday onwards (still a little sick today). Didn't get around to weighing myself once. Averaged ~2661cals/day (well above 2000cals/day target). I lifted, judo-d, and jiu-jitsued 1x, and ran 2x. Basically from Wednesday onwards I took it easy with just a couple bike rides and one run. I let myself go Saturday night after Stopa brought home some cookies -- ate two pints of ben and jerrys and several oreos. I haven't done that in awhile, I think I was fed up with being sick and trying to stick with diet goals. I ate excess calories earlier in the week and was doing a good job offsetting it, but the hunger/stress caught up with me. Offsetting excess definitely takes a toll.\n\nI also discovered towards the end of the week I've been under-estimating my peanut butter and dates calories -- resulting in under-reporting anywhere between 300-800 calories each day. I discovered this by 1. Using an actual tablespoon to measure a PB serving and realizing I was eating roughly 2x the amount and 2. Looking closer at the nutritional information of the dates and realizing it was ~2x calories I thought. Going forward will adjust my PB/date intake accordingly. I've also noticed that my caloric is roughly 40% carbs, 40% fats, 20% protein. I want to move this more to 40% carbs, 30% fats, and 30% protein (or roughly 200C, 75F, 150P for 2k calories). A simple adjustment to help achieve this would be to replace one of my regular PB servings with greek yogurt, so will be doing that too.\n\nAs of today (Monday) I'm still a little sick but feeling good to workout! Let's get back on the healthy train :)","5/10/2021":"This week averaged 150.3lb weight, ~2555cals/day, lifted 2x, BJJ 3x, ran 1x, did a Muay Thai class, and no Judo. My average weight increased this week over last and my calories were way above target mostly due to eating out with friends. This happened towards the end of the week, for the most of the week I ate pretty clean and consistently which led me to having a great mood. I certainly should have reigned it in when eating out, but I definitely let myself go a bit this week. Maybe I needed it, it's been six week since I started and was potentially feeling some diet stress.\n\nExercise-wise pretty happy with last week. No Judo was a shame but couldn't fit it in due to social gatherings and wanting to do more BJJ. I will be starting a new schedule this week where I'll be waking up early during the work week. This is to enable a schedule of BJJ 5x a week + Judo 3x a week. Furthermore will still aim for lifting 3x a week (2x a week is guarenteed thanks to training with Trevor, so just need to do one on my own) and reduce running down to 1x.\n\nComing into this new week I'm feeling strong and energized for workouts. I want this week to be consistent like the beginning of last week, and just more strict about eating out.","5/3/2021":"Last week was tougher than I thought. I had three red days, three blue days, and one green -- lots of caloric variance. I averaged ~2100/cal per day vs my goal of 1950. This was slightly better than last week. Similarly weight-wise moved down slightly, back to sub 150 terrority, averaging 149.7lb.\n\nEarly in the week I felt hungrier and ate excess calories. I tried to offset this in the following days and would eat low calories for most of the day. However, at night I would \"crack\" and eat a ton. Although late night eating was mostly clean, it meant I again would eat little the following day. This was tough to endure mentally. I was able to mostly offset calories by end of week, but due to eating out with friends, still came in higher than target.\n\nExercise-wise I lifted 3x, ran 1x, Jiu-Jitsu 2x, and Judo 3x. In addition I biked 4x for 30min-1hr. Overall lots of exercise this week, and the body definitely felt it. I still want to be better about lifting and keep my eye on running -- definitely ran less last week. I spent a lot of time watching BJJ/Judo videos last week so it was tougher to fit in non-class based workouts.\n\nFor this week I want to be more mindful about not giving into late-night cravings and keep caloric intake steady. For the month of April I only had one green-dominant week and that was definitely the week I felt the best. Let's get back to that!","4/26/2021":"This was a pretty wild week for me. Very social and lots of eating out (4x this week). Not a single green day last week — everything was either over or under calories. Overall calories came in around 200 above target. I did lots of BJJ/Judo/Runs so was able to offset excess a bit to bring weight slightly down vs last week.\n\nThis week should be much better for the diet since I currently have no dinners planned!\n\nExercise-wise I ran 3x, BJJ 3x Judo 2x and lifted 2x. Happy about all except lifting — I’ve been doing 2x for most of the last six weeks. Will try to hit 4x this week!","4/18/2021":"Overall this was a great week in terms of diet! Calories were below target and macros were on-point! Every day was a green or blue day so no excess of calories. Last time I ate this clean was week of Nov 9th (aka 6 months ago). I would say\nthis primarily due to the fact I had no dinner plans this week so never ate out. Thanks to Snapkitchen + some groceries was easy to eat clean\n\nI also got braces (invisalign) on Tuesday which definitely makes eating / drinking\nannoying. On the plus side, this means it will be easier to turn down dinner plans due to the hassle of needing to clean teeth afterwards. Of course I will still do dinners every now and then (we have a birthday dinner coming up for a friend), but\nI'm actually happy to have an excuse to turn down spontaenous dinner plans for now.\n\nI did Jiu-Jitsu 5x this week and lifted 3x which was great. However, I did not run Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Went on a run on Sunday, but Sunday is supposed to be test day for workouts, which I'll skip today because I'm pooped. I skipped the runs due to a combination of it being rainy last week + adjusting to braces life. Tl;dr I hope to be more on point with running this week.\n\nI'm checking out a Judo school as well tomorrow -- very excited about that! If I like the school will sign up immediately. Judo is 3x a week and it conflicts with BJJ. However, BJJ is 6x a week. As a result, I'm really gonna try to prioritize doing both BJJ and Judo 3x a week (Judo MWF, BJJ TuThuSa) so 6x a week workouts in addition to running and lifting. There will be exceptions of course (like the birthday dinner) -- but I will make those more rare than in the past with last minute dinner plans. I can also do double classes for BJJ on Tuesday and Saturday (Gi + No-Gi) so will try that this week too!\n\nLet's gooooo!","4/11/2021":"Shared my six-pack goal with my buddy Jan and he said he wanted to join. We agreed to send each other\nweekly reviews so I'm back to writing reflections -- sweet!\n\nI'll reflect on the last two weeks here. Two weeks ago was when I was re-invigorated to wotk towards\nthe six pack again. The first week went excellent -- my calories were very clean and I only ate out\nonce. This week I ate out four times, which made it much harder to keep overall calories low. I was\nable to offset the excess calories a bit by eating less on the non eating out days, but this certainly\ntook a mental toll.\n\nI ate out four times due to social gatherings with friends. Although I love seeing my friends, going forward\nI will be limiting eating out to no more than twice a week. This means I will be turning down dinner plans. In\nthe last two weeks I've given up smoking and it's definitely had a positve impact on my fitness and overall\nfeeling of wellness. I imagine restricting eating out will have similar benefits.\n\nLooking forward to the week ahead!","1/3/2021":"My eating/fitness was deifnitely not in-line with my overall goals during the holidays.\n\nThat being said, the holidays have come and gone and it's now 2021 -- w00t! Time to bring back those good habits :)\n\n**Goals for next week:**\n\n-   Average <= 2,050cals/week\n-   Trevor workout 7/7\n\nFor my own curiousity I did a quick and dirty analysis of my foods since I started tracking.\n\nTwo things stood out to me:\n\n-   11 of the foods are “snacky”, 7 foods are “mealy”, and 2 foods were desert\n-   Looks like on average when I ate B&J ice cream I would eat a whole pints worth\n\nSome take-aways\n\n-   Will work on cutting down the average dessert intake. One idea is to introduce more frequent smaller treats. I realize I actually did this for awhile back in August / September with the chocolate almonds and I didn't touch ice cream during that time. Having a little bit of sugar instead of a lot at once is probably better than what I've been doing the last few weeks\n-   Will get back into cooking to increase pct of calories that come from \"meal-centric\" foods. I think bulk cooking will be a huge help for this!\n\nOther thoughts\n\n-   I recorded 6 full day fasts during this time period in addition to a few < 500cal days. Most often these full day fasts were re-active due to an excess the previous day. I believe only once or twice it was a pro-active fast. I actually like fasting because it feels like a cleanse. However I would rather do it more pro-actively than re-actively.\n-   For 2021 will try to be better at managing the wild swings to caloric ranges\n-   The main offenders for caloric excess seem to fall in the following categories\n    -   Gave in to excess eating (e.g. B&J). This became a problem after I stopped buying the chocolate almonds. To counter this will introduce small dessert snacking again.\n    -   Eating out in restaurants with friends. In these situations I will try to be mindful of how much and how fast I am eating. I think I should still enjoy my time out with friends, but instead simply eat slower and eat less\n    -   Hosting friends and over-snacking. Often times I also want to partake in the snacking. I can try to plan ahead and adjust my caloric so I can indulge. Regardless I should practice mindful eating in those situations. Eat slower and portion out the snacks instead of just grabbing them\n\nBelow is the list of the top 20 foods which contributed roughly ~80% of my caloric intake\n\n| food                      | totalCals | count | avgCals |  pct  |\n| :------------------------ | :-------: | :---: | :-----: | :---: |\n| Mixed Nuts, Dry Roasted   |   42644   |  147  |   290   | 13.12 |\n| Date                      |   21927   |  213  |   103   | 6.75  |\n| Greek Yogurt: Vanilla     |   19947   |  83   |   240   | 6.14  |\n| Salami                    |   16717   |  106  |   158   | 5.14  |\n| Greek Yogurt              |   15715   |  60   |   262   | 4.83  |\n| Havarti Cheese            |   14830   |  107  |   139   | 4.56  |\n| Sunflower Seed Butter     |   14750   |  62   |   238   | 4.54  |\n| Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream |   11967   |  10   |  1197   | 3.68  |\n| Grapes                    |   11958   |  69   |   173   | 3.68  |\n| Salmon                    |   11645   |  32   |   364   | 3.58  |\n| Dark Chocolate Almonds    |   10453   |  58   |   180   | 3.22  |\n| Fried Egg                 |   9281    |  45   |   206   | 2.86  |\n| Grilled Chicken           |   9060    |  30   |   302   | 2.79  |\n| Avocado Oil               |   7980    |  57   |   140   | 2.45  |\n| Ground Beef               |   6901    |  22   |   314   | 2.12  |\n| PB acai Bowl              |   6683    |  13   |   514   | 2.06  |\n| Protein Powder            |   5697    |  36   |   158   | 1.75  |\n| Strawberries              |   5669    |  66   |   86    | 1.74  |\n| Raw Carrots               |   5363    |  82   |   65    | 1.65  |\n| Apple                     |   4280    |  44   |   97    | 1.32  |","12/15/2020":"I missed writing a reflection on Sunday but still wanted to get one in for the\nweek.\n\nGoals from previous week:\n\n-   (Success, 1 red day) 2 or less red days\n-   (Fail, worked-out 3x) Workout all 7 days, following new schedule (VT + runs + test + weekend workouts)\n-   (Fail, cooked 2x) Cook food for next day at least 3x\n-   (Success, 3x Jiu-Jitsu) Jiu-Jitsu at least 3x\n\nThoughts for the week\n\n-   Ate clean again M -> TH\n-   F -> Su was very social and lots of excess\n-   Ate a few home-cooked meals which where great\n-   However, wasn't motivated enough to cook more than 2x, it definitely takes some energy to follow-through at night\n-   Failed the 7x workout early on, missed both my runs on Tuesday/Thursday mainly because it was hard to wake up early and it was cold outside\n-   Although I had only 1 red day, calories were higher on average this week at ~2.25k\n-   Was able to hit BJJ 3x which felt great. Ideally will be going 5x but it's hard to make that 7:30am morning class\n\nThe beginning of last week started off great, but once the weekend came things went off the rails. We\nwere very social last weekend, going to the same Georgia restaurant twice and hosting folks. Not only\ndid this lead to excess calories, but I smoked a lot of hookah and got < 6 hours of sleep 3 nights in\na row. This was very tough on my body and made me let go of my other habits (like writing a reflection).\nThankfully I'm now feeling reset.\n\nGoing forward, I want to be more aware of weekend excess. A part of me wanted to let loose, but it was too much. Not\nsure how to formulate this goal more concretely yet. One thing I do know though is that I want to cut back on hookah.\nAlthough I'm setting this mid-week, here's my goals for the upcoming week.\n\n-   2 or less red days\n-   Run at least 1x, Workout at least 2x F -> Sun\n-   Don't smoke hookah more than 2x\n\nIn other news, small update to the website -- I added a reflections tab! I've noticed I've been wanting\nthis for a few weeks now so decided to add it in. I use a hueristic (> X words) to determine what\nqualifies as a \"reflection\" and then collect all my notes that fulfill that criteria and list it on one page.","12/6/2020":"Thoughts for this week\n\n-   Ate pretty clean M -> TH\n-   Got some baked cookies from a friend, was a great gift and indulged a bit.\n-   Ate >6K calories on Friday, which was extreme. Ended up just letting go\n-   To make up for the extreme excess, I fasted for two days straight, also extreme\n-   This week had the largest intra-week weight difference ~6.8lbs.\n-   Lowest weight: Monday, 147.8 (post fast from previous week)\n-   Highest weight: Saturday, 154.6 (post 6k calories on Friday)\n-   Despite extremes, met goal of <2 red days. Also kept average carbs to <200/day\n-   Was connected to at least 3 workouts -- but barely.\n\nThis was another strange week. Monday -> Thursday were pretty good with solid\nworkouts on Monday, Wednesday, and doing 100 pull-ups test. Started Jiu-Jitsu again this week which was great.\nOn Friday however I went to a friend's party and let go. To top it off, I ate\n2lbs of ice cream after coming home. This was my biggest calorie day since I started\nlogging. This also caused a huge (but temporary) increase on the scale, leading to\nmy largest intra-week weight range. To make up for this I fasted for 2 days straight,\nor what came out to be ~55hours between the ice cream and my next meal. Another\nrecord since starting to record.\n\nDespite these extremes happy to say I did meet both my goals last week (although\nsomewhat barely i.e. working out). I'm glad the goals were more realistic. I want\nto push harder on the workout goal so will be more ambitious for next week.\n\nI'm aware we've been ordering out more and more. I prefer not to cook\nduring the day/afternoon now since it interferes with our working schedule.\nWe don't eat junk when we do deliviery which is good, But still some of the food\nis loaded with sodium and I know that's not optimal for work-outs + Jiu-Jitsu.\nLast week I tried cooking in the evening for consumption the following day. This\nworked out pretty well and I want to try making this a habit going forward.\n\nI got back on bananas, bread, and sunflower-seed butter this week. I noticed\nthat eating a carb-centric meal 2-3 hours before working out with Trevor or Jiu-Jitsu\nhas a positive impact on my energy levels. Previously I would eat a more carb\nheavy meal earlier in the day and a protein heavy meal for dinner. Will try\nswitching it up so that the protein heavy meal is for breakfast/lunch and the carb\nloaded meal is for dinner M-F.\n\nFor the following week will shoot for these goals.\n\n-   2 or less red days\n-   Workout all 7 days, following new schedule (VT + runs + test + weekend workouts)\n-   Cook food for next day at least 3x\n-   Jiu-Jitsu at least 3x","11/29/2020":"Quick thoughts for this week\n\n-   Thanksgiving week turned out to be a doozy in terms of diet and fitness.\n-   Ate pretty clean Monday -> Wednesday\n-   Thursday -> Saturday was rougher.\n-   Ate >4K calories on Thanksgiving, although this was expected\n-   Tried fasting for most of Friday, but gave in to cravings and ate cake which lead to >3K calories\n-   Fasted for most of Friday but had dinner with friends and then ice cream\n-   Successfully fasted full day on Sunday\n-   Ended up with 3 green days, 2 red days, and 2 blue days. Did not hit 5+ green days.\n-   Overall calories were >2k avg for the week, but not as bad as coudl have been given it was Turkey day week\n-   Did not exercise though Thursday -> Sunday.\n\nLooking at my goals from last week, I literally did not hit a single one. Somewhat\ndisappointing. Reflecting on exercise, I realize I've been getting disconnected\nwith my workouts. I want to re-connect with them and put more heart into my fitness.\n\nIn general I know it's hard for me to break through the 150lb range. I know I can do\nit though. I'm feeling pumped.\n\nFor this week will try to sit different goals:\n\n-   2 or less red days. Thinking < X red days I think is more realistic than Y green days. Since if a red day does happen, I may want to make up for it with a blue day.\n-   Be connected to at least 3 workouts this week. I can evaluate for myself whether I'm truly into my workout.","11/22/2020":"This was a bit of a strange week. Definitely did not hit all greens. On the positive side, average calories were still <2000.\n\nOverview:\n\n-   Had two wisdom teeth extracted on Monday\n-   Could not exercise until Thursday\n-   Only worked out twice this week\n-   No Jiu-Jitsu\n-   Ate delivery 5 / 7 days\n-   Lots of carbs/sodium Wednesday onwards\n-   Three red days, weight drifted up intra-week\n-   Made up for it by fasting\n-   Had ice-cream again end-of-week (fit into calories)\n\nThankfully my wisdom teeth operation was quick and painless and the recovery so far has been pretty easy. Was able to be productive work wise Tuesday onwards.\n\nHowever, was not able to do Jiu-Jitsu (and won't be able to until Wednesday) and workout as much. I only worked out twice this week (Thursday and Saturday) and overall moved a lot less than usual.\n\nAlthough my calorie average came out to <2000, there were three red days. My carb + sodium in-take went way up (ate lots of fruits and ate out) Wednesday onwards which resulted in my weight drifting up and feeling bloated. To counter this I did a full-day fast -- which balanced things out.\n\nNext week is turkey day. Will likely have excess calories that day. Will likely make up for the excess on Friday. Will allow a potential excess on Sunday too if it fits in with my calories/macros.\n\nGoals for next week:\n\n-   < 2000 cals/avg\n-   < 200 carbs/avg\n-   5+ green days\n-   Exercise everyday (potential hike on Sunday can count as exercise as well)","11/21/2020":"Felt a bit heavy last few days so decided to do a fast day today!","11/19/2020":"So far wisdom teeth recovery has gone well! Started eating cooked food and working out today. Ended up eating lots of grapes today, not sure why, just really wanted\nsome carbs. Will aim to keep the reminaing days in the green :)","11/15/2020":"Succeeded with all greens this week! Feels good :)\n\nWas nice to mix in some eating out as well, even fit in an ice cream that worked\nwith the calories and macros. Worked out everyday and hit almost all my habits\nevery day this week. I think hitting my habits in addition to clean diet + exercise makes me feel good overall.\n\nGetting some wisdom teeth extracted tomorrow so will be restricted in terms of workout and some eating. Nonethless, let's get another week of all greens in :)","11/13/2020":"Another clean day :) So far M-F this week has been all greens -- feels good! I've been consistent with all my other habits this week as well. Definitely notice that\nconsistently eating clean + doing habits results in being more productive and happy. Will keep it green for this weekend as well!","11/9/2020":"Goals for this week:\n\n-   All greens (no excuses)\n-   Wake up 6:45am every day (Sa/Sun included)\n\nCalorie-wise this was the heaviest week since I started logging. Several things happened this week\n\n-   Got tired of cooking every meal so tried ordering out, had a gyro from Halal Guys and a burrito from Chiptole\n-   It is actually reasonable to get healthy food from ordering out!\n-   However the food is loaded with sodium, so I don't feel as satiated vs. if I cooked at home\n-   It was Stopa's bday this week and we celebrated hardcore with Ben and Jerrys -- had ice cream three times this week!\n-   I indulged in our catered party food. Ended up eating lots of yummy turkish food, chocolates, and cake.\n-   Not sure if this actually impacted anything, curiously though, it was election week, things were stressful in the nation.\n\nI noticed myself making lots of excuses this week. Ice cream for a birthday is reasonable. Trying the food we are serving to our guests is reasonable, etc. It's easy to justify why it's okay to let diet slide, but it really is just an excuse.\n\nI didn't do any Trevor workouts on my own either this week. So in addition to poor diet -- wasn't on top of fitness either. However, I did go to Jiu-Jitsu 2x and it's feeling much easier on my body. Very happy to be back to training.\n\nLast week I wanted to reduce the nuts and dates. Heh I did do that, but indulged in other things. This week I want to reset back to clean diet -- keeping in mind \"no excuses\". Also, I need to wake up 6:45am on MWF to make it to Jiu-Jitsu. That's definitely early, but I like that by the time I'm done with class and back home I already feel great and it's pretty much the time I was starting to work at before. If I wake up daily 6:45 it will probably be a better schedule than just MWF -- so will try that out!","11/2/2020":"Gonna start trying to do reviews of the previous week on Mondays. This past week was a bit all over the place. Started the week off after a huge caloric weekend which spilled over a bit to last Monday. For the most part though the excess calories were cleaner. I started training at a Jiu-Jitsu gym this week which definitely led to an increased appetitie. Calories were a bit higher this week but food was relatively clean. Saturday was Halloween and Sunday was Jordan's birthday so indulged in some sweets but was able to make up for it by mostly fasting on Sunday.\n\nAverage calories came out to 2126 and macros were 115g protein, 111g fat, 182g carbs. Again weekend/social eating was the biggest offender in terms of diet, although this week was much better. I also notice I've been eating a lot of nuts and sometimes excess dates. Will try to keep both foods to two servings max per day and substitue with more veggies and/or protein -- this should lower calories a bit and make more room for protein.\n\nLooking at the heat-map, calories were not consistent. We have Stopa's birthday this week so may be a challenege to keep things all green -- but will shoot for that anyway :)","10/27/2020":"Lots of workouts, made up calories from previous days, Today felt like a reset!","10/26/2020":"Even after that amazing dinner with friends came home and snacked a ton. Resulted\nin another day of excess calories.\n\nI also missed Trevor's workouts four days in a row now... time to get back on\nschedule!","10/25/2020":"Oof the late night drunchies hit hard. We also spent the whole day with friends\nwho cooked delicious food. A gastronmic day overall.","10/24/2020":"Today was overall lower calories until the evening. Had a date and ended\nup drinking a beer, this would set off some serious drunchies after...","10/23/2020":"Had Georgian food with some friends in the evening! So yummy. Was able to keep\ncalories mostly in control.","10/18/2020":"Cleanest week to date :)","10/13/2020":"Back on track!","10/12/2020":"Pushed out a few updates!\n\n1. Images are tagged by their \"meal group\" which is determined based on time between other images (makes the actual groupings)\n   and labeled based on time of day (breakfast/lunch/dinner) and total calories of meal group (snack/meal/large meal)\n2. Daily trends are now weekly trends amd each data point includes the min, average, and max value for that week\n3. New heatmap for showing average intra-day calorie consumption (values are based on last 7 days, last 30 days, etc.)\n4. New heatmap for showing daily calories\n5. New heatmap for sharing water consumption\n\nAlthough I'm happy to have pushed this out I didn't make time for actual workouts! 😅 Let's get back on it :)","10/9/2020":"Oof, last few days were rough i.e. nutrition. Something about the ice cream from\nSunday set me off and I gave in. Today was a fast to reset and will try to be\nmindful about calories for next two days.\n\nFasting-wise today felt good. Felt minimal hunger, although considering I ate\n5k calories yesterday that's not unreasonable.\n\nPushed an update to group foods together as well! I notice just by looking at\nthe number of meals and snacks I have in a day I can roughly gauge how clean my\nday was. I aim to use this as an indicator to be more meal-centric and less snacky.","10/6/2020":"Lower cals today to make up for previous day excess. Will lilely do lower cals\ntomorrow as well","10/5/2020":"Was in a bit of a funk over the weekend due to lower calories + odd meal timing.\nIndulged in a ton of Ice cream on Sunday which honestly made me feel better. However\nI definitely was above 2k cals/day average this week. What a shame, were it not\nfor the excess ice cream I would have been under! Oh well, new week -- new streak!\n\nThat being said, started the week with excess 😅 Hosted my sister and her boyfriend\nfor an evening hang today which led to eating some yummy yet sugary snacks.\n\nThese excess calories keep happening with evening hangs. My approach so far has\nbeen to simply allow it and then fast the next day to make up for the calories.\nThis is what I will be doing tomorrow.\n\nI don't know if this pattern is sustainable -- perhaps a better alternative would\nbe to abstain from the excess calories or budget for it earlier in the day? We'll\nbe hosting friends again on Wednesday and I think doing a second fast this week\nwill be annoying. I'll abstain on Wednesday and see how that feels","10/2/2020":"Yesterday was a bigger calorie day due to hosting friends. Was happy that all the\nexcess was healthy foods. Made it easier to fast for most of the day. The calories\nI had today were all for workout and hookah afterwards (the apple was during\nhookah so I don't get light-headed)","9/27/2020":"A few notes to share:\n\nAbout today: Another full day hang with friends. Had only one real meal (thai food)\ntoday where I was suuuuuper hungry and definitely had a bigger meal. Because it\nwas effectively my first / only meal my calories did not go over. However, I was\nstill hungry so when hosting friends after dinner indulged in some snacking.\nOverall was a sporadic eating day\n\nTargets: I've been logging for almost 100 days! My eating target from the onset\nwas ~2000 cal/day. Looking at this time period, looks like I've actually been\naveraging 2050-2100/cal a day. Not too far off from the goal! During this time\nperiod I've also dropped ~10+ lbs, became more consistent with workouts (hit 20 consecutive ring pull-ups today!), and\noverall feeling pretty good! I think this calorie range is pretty sustainable\nso will keep shooting for average ~2000 cal/day. Looking to get down to ~140lb\nmorning weight (which translates to be about ~145lb walking around weight)\n\nThoughts: It's not always easy to eat strictly ~2000 calories a day. I notice\nduring the weekdays it's easier for me to restrict calories since I'm focused\non work and cook at home. On weekends / social evening it's very easy for calories\nto go over. Sometimes it's easy to make healthy choices when going out, but other\ntimes it's much more difficult (for example eating dinner at a pizza place). Also\nsometimes when I'm out I want to indulge in a treat (like ice-cream, or trying\ncanoli for the first time).\n\nI notice as long as my calories aren't too overboard (over 4k) I can simply make up\nfor the excess by fasting the next day. As a bonus I feel cleansed the day after fasting.Altthough it is a bit emotionally taxing, there is something rejuvenating about fasting. I notice fasting is easier if I ate healthier food before the\nexcess -- the nutrition keeps me fueled and satiated. Perhaps one take-away is\nthat even if I'm going to eat out and there are no healthy options -- ensure I\nate healthy food earlier to reduce my excess appetitie and make it easier to\nrestrict calories the following day.\n\nFurthermore, I'm finding it useful to think of my \"calorie balance\" on a weekly\nbasis. My goal Monday - Sunday is to average ~2000 cal/day or 14,000 calories total.\nIf I kept under the weekly balance then great! If I went over then I start anew\nthe following Monday. Similarly if I was under my balance does not carry over. I've\nbeen using this approach the last two weeks and like it better than what I was doing\npreviously of keeping a running tally of the last seven days. Will see if this\nsticks.\n\nFinally, although most of the time I'm pretty good about logging -- on social\ndays there may be longer periods of time where I haven't logged any food. This may\nmake it easier to go over budget since I don't have a clear idea of how much\nI've already eaten. On those occassions, I can try to log between social meals\nto get an idea of how many calories I've already consumed (for example, log\ncalories between pizza and ice cream). This could help curb excess calories or\nreduce post-social meal snacking (which sometimes just puts me over budget, like\nin the case of this week).\n\nIn general I've been pretty good about eating healthy at home. I imagine if I\nnever went out it would be much more straightforward to hit nutritional targets.\nThe interesting challenge is meeting those targets while still being social. I think\nI'm getting better at it and I think these take-aways (eat healthy as opposed to save\ncalories before social meals, think weekly calorie balance as opposed to last seven\ndays running total, and log between social meals and snacking to get visibility of\ntotal consumption) will help!","9/26/2020":"Very social last few days! Calories went over the last two days but made it up\ntoday :)","9/22/2020":"Cut my thumb today while prepping food for cooking :( -- nothing serious but\nan inconvenience!\n\nOtherwise good day all around :)","9/20/2020":"Hosted guests this weekend and definitely did not eat as healthy! One thing I've\nbeen noticing more and more is that eating things like cake / cheat foods is just\nnot worth it. The satisfaction I get from them is vastly lower than before and\nI know I need to make up for it the following days. This is making me want junk\nless and less.\n\nOn the up-side, compared to previous excess days, this weekend was far lower than\nusual. I definitely feel like the diet is iterating towards getting cleaner and\ncleaner :)","9/13/2020":"Fast day!","9/12/2020":"Housewarming and bday celebration last night! Very very fun! We had three different cakes!! Lots\nof treats too. Knew today was gonna be a big one in terms of calories. Will make\nup for the excess on Sunday.","9/7/2020":"Solid day. Love how doing the simple things makes the rest of the day feel good :)","9/6/2020":"Very social weekend! Calories were def over. Started dating again and realize\nthat I don't want to do the whole alcohol + food thing. Un-neccesary calories,\ndrunchies, and feeling sluggish the next day is no fun. Already updated my\nprofiles to reflect the distate for alcohol :)","9/4/2020":"Made shrimp for the first time yesterday! Came out pretty good. Had leftovers\nso finished them up today. One thing I've noticed is when I have bigger meals\n(like today breakfast was bigger) I feel sluggish after and then have hunger\ncravings sooner (maybe it's because I have less focus -> giving into distraction)\nWill try having \"meals\" not be as large","9/2/2020":"We back on track :)","9/1/2020":"Solid day! Back on the groceries life :)","8/31/2020":"Another off day in terms of diet -- but now we have proper groceries! Will be\nback on tracking tomorrow :)","8/30/2020":"Oof, went overboard on the calories today. We were moving today so wasn't able\nto really eat properly. Had a small brunch and then worked at a cafe for the\nafternoon until dinner. After dinner just had some sugar cravings and gave in.\nI think I'll not worry about making up for excess calories last two days and try\nto get back to normal. May start doing pro-active fasts later this week to build\nup caloric deficencies ahead of time as a buffer for dinners with friends. This\nway I don't need to correct in a reactive way","8/29/2020":"Bit of sporadic day, eating times were far spread apart which definitely lead\nto more calories, but oh well!","8/28/2020":"Half-fast today! Making up for previous day excess. One thing that's definitely\nnice about the logging is it makes excess / defciences very visible. This\nenables action. Like in this case since I over-ate yesterday will \"under-eat\" a\nbit today and continue as normal tomorrow!","8/27/2020":"Had some Ethopian food with friends tonight. Sooooo yummy. Calories were definitely\nover but oh well. Can make it up tomorrow","8/26/2020":"Another chill day. Energy levels felt good, workout felt good. Reading-filled day :)","8/25/2020":"Chill day. Made eggs again today, so yummy. Makes me think more and more about\nbeing meal-centric. Perhaps I can work towards doing something like eggs in AM,\ndeli-wrap for lunch, and then proper dinner. It is nice to snack a bit mid day\nas a break between work and for re-fueling. But perhaps with more meal-centric\nfood will have less need to snack","8/24/2020":"Another day of 2x workouts! Energy felt good for most of day. Home cooking / good\nmacros makes a difference!","8/23/2020":"Dinner was delicious. Tried cooking the tomatoes and cucumbers with the chicken\nand frozen veggies. Came out wonderful. There's something I really enjoy about\nhome cooking.\n\nOverall productive day. Lots of reading and 2x workouts (3+ hours total!)","8/22/2020":"Lower energy day. Tried getting through trevor's workout but was feeling tired.\nLikely due to the fasting from previous day + lots of hookah (almost every other\nday for the last few weeks now). Will start limiting smoking amount","8/21/2020":"Fasted for most of the day to make up for excess calories! Had decent energy\nthroughout the day and even got in two workouts! Was definitely tempted to eat\nin the evening but managed to stay strong!","8/20/2020":"Another big calorie day. Walked/biked all over NYC apartment hunting. Got some\nyummy NYC staples. Street food, shake shack, and local gelato, nom nom","8/16/2020":"Lots of calories today! Had an epic dinner with some friends. Definitely went overboard but oh well, I enjoyed it :)","8/15/2020":"Action packed day! 7mi bike ride, 10k steps from exploring, and jiu-jitsu in the\nevening. Visited my sis and her bf and had lunch and sweets together. Happy to\nbe keeping calories in check","8/12/2020":"Noticed I've been snacking more lately and especially eating lots of the chocolate\nalmonds. Will try to get more meal centric. Trevor had a good suggestion to get\na water jug too -- I think this is a good idea for hitting the 8 cups / water a\nday goal.\n\nNew feature added too -- now including trend data for weight!","8/11/2020":"Stayed up a bit late last night so was a bit lower energy. However\nfinished up Export Health! with Stopa which felt great. Got some Jiu Jitsu in\nthe evening as well. Calories came in a bit lower today and honestly could\nfeel it in my workout. I remarked on this yesterday but yea, I want to be\nmore on top of drinking water. I'm also trying to incoporate more stretching\nand new foods recommended by Trevor.\n\nI guess there's a been a lot of new stuff incoporated lately. Hanging with people\nmore, eating out more often, running outside, training Jiu-Jitsu, stretching. Doing\nlots of new things can feel like a chore, so maybe if I'm feeling like it's getting\ntoo annoying I can cut back on something (maybe replace some workouts with stretch + runs?).\nWill feel this out.\n\nOverall though solid day, really proud of Export Health!, happy to be doing\nJiu-Jitsu again, and happy to be eating clean.","8/10/2020":"After a culinary weekend back to some home cooking. Felt nice to home food again.\nNoticed I haven't been as good about drinking 8 cups of water last week. Will try\nto be on top of this up again -- I really do think the extra water = extra energy","8/9/2020":"Met up with some friends in the evening and had some yummy dinner!","8/8/2020":"Today was a full-day hang! Met up with a buddy Jon for some delicious Goergian food\nand NYC roaming followed by Jiu-Jitsu and homemade tacos with our buddy Jan. Fun day!","8/7/2020":"Was working most of day and didn't make time for proper meals so did more snacking. Kept the snacking\nthough mostly protein/fats related. In the evening went out with friends for Thai food!","8/4/2020":"2nd day of freedom! Had some K-BBQ w/ friends. Still a bit excess on calories, but\nensured to plan better for going out. Also, first run today, felt amazing","8/3/2020":"First day of freedom! Got to meet up with some friends and have some street foods!\nCalories definitely added up, but wow >20k steps from all the exploring :)","8/2/2020":"Was a bit lower energy today so caloried up. Was low calories yesterday so balances yet. Excited to go exploring tomorrow!","8/1/2020":"Made a few tweaks to the site! Added water and weight tracking to entries.\nTwo weeks ago I also added swiping (left/right) on mobile when previewing\nentries and keyboard shortcuts (left/right/esc/x) on desktop.","7/19/2020":"Today was a travel day and make-up for yesterday's excess!","7/18/2020":"Another huge calorie day. Was hanging/celebrating with friends. Ate ~2400cals\nalone from snacking in the evening. Had I reigned this in, would have been within\ncalorie targets across the two days\n\nCelebrating is good, but gotta be more on top of excess in these situations!","7/17/2020":"Mini fast in the evening to prepare for a magic evening!","7/15/2020":"Ended up fasting almost the entire day to make up for the excess intake the\nprevious day. Was over-full for most of the day so this was easy to do. Felt\nmuch better after going on a run. Ate a few dates before doing a second workout.\nFelt great by end of day. Back to regular eating tomorrow!","7/14/2020":"Calories were wayyy overboard today.\n\nHad late dinner with friends which resulted in going over 2000 calories target.\nCalorie total was only around 2250 though so not a huge amount over initially.\nHowever I ended up \"tilting\" and going \"all out\" afterwards. No bueno. Will keep\nin mind that just because I went a little over doesn't mean I should tilt."} };
