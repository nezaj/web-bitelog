Felt\nmuch better after going on a run. Ate a few dates before doing a second workout.\nFelt great by end of day. Back to regular eating tomorrow!","7/14/2020":"Calories were wayyy overboard today.\n\nHad late dinner with friends which resulted in going over 2000 calories target.\nCalorie total was only around 2250 though so not a huge amount over initially.\nHowever I ended up \"tilting\" and going \"all out\" afterwards. No bueno. Will keep\nin mind that just because I went a little over doesn't mean I should tilt."} };
