Ended up eating lots of grapes today, not sure why, just really wanted\nsome carbs. Will aim to keep the reminaing days in the green :)","11/15/2020":"Succeeded with all greens this week! Feels good :)\n\nWas nice to mix in some eating out as well, even fit in an ice cream that worked\nwith the calories and macros. Worked out everyday and hit almost all my habits\nevery day this week. I think hitting my habits in addition to clean diet + exercise makes me feel good overall.\n\nGetting some wisdom teeth extracted tomorrow so will be restricted in terms of workout and some eating. Nonethless, let's get another week of all greens in :)","11/13/2020":"Another clean day :) So far M-F this week has been all greens -- feels good! I've been consistent with all my other habits this week as well. Definitely notice that\nconsistently eating clean + doing habits results in being more productive and happy. Will keep it green for this weekend as well!","11/9/2020":"Goals for this week:\n\n-   All greens (no excuses)\n-   Wake up 6:45am every day (Sa/Sun included)\n\nCalorie-wise this was the heaviest week since I started logging. Several things happened this week\n\n-   Got tired of cooking every meal so tried ordering out, had a gyro from Halal Guys and a burrito from Chiptole\n-   It is actually reasonable to get healthy food from ordering out!\n-   However the food is loaded with sodium, so I don't feel as satiated vs. if I cooked at home\n-   It was Stopa's bday this week and we celebrated hardcore with Ben and Jerrys -- had ice cream three times this week!\n-   I indulged in our catered party food. Ended up eating lots of yummy turkish food, chocolates, and cake.\n-   Not sure if this actually impacted anything, curiously though, it was election week, things were stressful in the nation.\n\nI noticed myself making lots of excuses this week. Ice cream for a birthday is reasonable. Trying the food we are serving to our guests is reasonable, etc. It's easy to justify why it's okay to let diet slide, but it really is just an excuse.\n\nI didn't do any Trevor workouts on my own either this week. So in addition to poor diet -- wasn't on top of fitness either. However, I did go to Jiu-Jitsu 2x and it's feeling much easier on my body. Very happy to be back to training.\n\nLast week I wanted to reduce the nuts and dates. Heh I did do that, but indulged in other things. This week I want to reset back to clean diet -- keeping in mind \"no excuses\". Also, I need to wake up 6:45am on MWF to make it to Jiu-Jitsu. That's definitely early, but I like that by the time I'm done with class and back home I already feel great and it's pretty much the time I was starting to work at before. If I wake up daily 6:45 it will probably be a better schedule than just MWF -- so will try that out!","11/2/2020":"Gonna start trying to do reviews of the previous week on Mondays. This past week was a bit all over the place. Started the week off after a huge caloric weekend which spilled over a bit to last Monday. For the most part though the excess calories were cleaner. I started training at a Jiu-Jitsu gym this week which definitely led to an increased appetitie. Calories were a bit higher this week but food was relatively clean. Saturday was Halloween and Sunday was Jordan's birthday so indulged in some sweets but was able to make up for it by mostly fasting on Sunday.\n\nAverage calories came out to 2126 and macros were 115g protein, 111g fat, 182g carbs. Again weekend/social eating was the biggest offender in terms of diet, although this week was much better. I also notice I've been eating a lot of nuts and sometimes excess dates. Will try to keep both foods to two servings max per day and substitue with more veggies and/or protein -- this should lower calories a bit and make more room for protein.\n\nLooking at the heat-map, calories were not consistent. We have Stopa's birthday this week so may be a challenege to keep things all green -- but will shoot for that anyway :)","10/27/2020":"Lots of workouts, made up calories from previous days, Today felt like a reset!","10/26/2020":"Even after that amazing dinner with friends came home and snacked a ton. Resulted\nin another day of excess calories.\n\nI also missed Trevor's workouts four days in a row now... time to get back on\nschedule!","10/25/2020":"Oof the late night drunchies hit hard. We also spent the whole day with friends\nwho cooked delicious food. A gastronmic day overall.","10/24/2020":"Today was overall lower calories until the evening. Had a date and ended\nup drinking a beer, this would set off some serious drunchies after...","10/23/2020":"Had Georgian food with some friends in the evening! So yummy. Was able to keep\ncalories mostly in control.","10/18/2020":"Cleanest week to date :)","10/13/2020":"Back on track!","10/12/2020":"Pushed out a few updates!\n\n1. Images are tagged by their \"meal group\" which is determined based on time between other images (makes the actual groupings)\n   and labeled based on time of day (breakfast/lunch/dinner) and total calories of meal group (snack/meal/large meal)\n2. Daily trends are now weekly trends amd each data point includes the min, average, and max value for that week\n3. New heatmap for showing average intra-day calorie consumption (values are based on last 7 days, last 30 days, etc.)\n4. New heatmap for showing daily calories\n5. New heatmap for sharing water consumption\n\nAlthough I'm happy to have pushed this out I didn't make time for actual workouts! ðŸ˜… Let's get back on it :)","10/9/2020":"Oof, last few days were rough i.e. nutrition. Something about the ice cream from\nSunday set me off and I gave in. Today was a fast to reset and will try to be\nmindful about calories for next two days.\n\nFasting-wise today felt good. Felt minimal hunger, although considering I ate\n5k calories yesterday that's not unreasonable.\n\nPushed an update to group foods together as well! I notice just by looking at\nthe number of meals and snacks I have in a day I can roughly gauge how clean my\nday was. I aim to use this as an indicator to be more meal-centric and less snacky.","10/6/2020":"Lower cals today to make up for previous day excess. Will lilely do lower cals\ntomorrow as well","10/5/2020":"Was in a bit of a funk over the weekend due to lower calories + odd meal timing.\nIndulged in a ton of Ice cream on Sunday which honestly made me feel better. However\nI definitely was above 2k cals/day average this week. What a shame, were it not\nfor the excess ice cream I would have been under! Oh well, new week -- new streak!\n\nThat being said, started the week with excess ðŸ˜… Hosted my sister and her boyfriend\nfor an evening hang today which led to eating some yummy yet sugary snacks.\n\nThese excess calories keep happening with evening hangs. My approach so far has\nbeen to simply allow it and then fast the next day to make up for the calories.\nThis is what I will be doing tomorrow.\n\nI don't know if this pattern is sustainable -- perhaps a better alternative would\nbe to abstain from the excess calories or budget for it earlier in the day? We'll\nbe hosting friends again on Wednesday and I think doing a second fast this week\nwill be annoying. I'll abstain on Wednesday and see how that feels","10/2/2020":"Yesterday was a bigger calorie day due to hosting friends. Was happy that all the\nexcess was healthy foods. Made it easier to fast for most of the day. The calories\nI had today were all for workout and hookah afterwards (the apple was during\nhookah so I don't get light-headed)","9/27/2020":"A few notes to share:\n\nAbout today: Another full day hang with friends. Had only one real meal (thai food)\ntoday where I was suuuuuper hungry and definitely had a bigger meal. Because it\nwas effectively my first / only meal my calories did not go over. However, I was\nstill hungry so when hosting friends after dinner indulged in some snacking.\nOverall was a sporadic eating day\n\nTargets: I've been logging for almost 100 days! My eating target from the onset\nwas ~2000 cal/day. Looking at this time period, looks like I've actually been\naveraging 2050-2100/cal a day. Not too far off from the goal! During this time\nperiod I've also dropped ~10+ lbs, became more consistent with workouts (hit 20 consecutive ring pull-ups today!), and\noverall feeling pretty good! I think this calorie range is pretty sustainable\nso will keep shooting for average ~2000 cal/day. Looking to get down to ~140lb\nmorning weight (which translates to be about ~145lb walking around weight)\n\nThoughts: It's not always easy to eat strictly ~2000 calories a day. I notice\nduring the weekdays it's easier for me to restrict calories since I'm focused\non work and cook at home. On weekends / social evening it's very easy for calories\nto go over. Sometimes it's easy to make healthy choices when going out, but other\ntimes it's much more difficult (for example eating dinner at a pizza place). Also\nsometimes when I'm out I want to indulge in a treat (like ice-cream, or trying\ncanoli for the first time).\n\nI notice as long as my calories aren't too overboard (over 4k) I can simply make up\nfor the excess by fasting the next day. As a bonus I feel cleansed the day after fasting.Altthough it is a bit emotionally taxing, there is something rejuvenating about fasting. I notice fasting is easier if I ate healthier food before the\nexcess -- the nutrition keeps me fueled and satiated. Perhaps one take-away is\nthat even if I'm going to eat out and there are no healthy options -- ensure I\nate healthy food earlier to reduce my excess appetitie and make it easier to\nrestrict calories the following day.\n\nFurthermore, I'm finding it useful to think of my \"calorie balance\" on a weekly\nbasis. My goal Monday - Sunday is to average ~2000 cal/day or 14,000 calories total.\nIf I kept under the weekly balance then great! If I went over then I start anew\nthe following Monday. Similarly if I was under my balance does not carry over. I've\nbeen using this approach the last two weeks and like it better than what I was doing\npreviously of keeping a running tally of the last seven days. Will see if this\nsticks.\n\nFinally, although most of the time I'm pretty good about logging -- on social\ndays there may be longer periods of time where I haven't logged any food. This may\nmake it easier to go over budget since I don't have a clear idea of how much\nI've already eaten. On those occassions, I can try to log between social meals\nto get an idea of how many calories I've already consumed (for example, log\ncalories between pizza and ice cream). This could help curb excess calories or\nreduce post-social meal snacking (which sometimes just puts me over budget, like\nin the case of this week).\n\nIn general I've been pretty good about eating healthy at home. I imagine if I\nnever went out it would be much more straightforward to hit nutritional targets.\nThe interesting challenge is meeting those targets while still being social. I think\nI'm getting better at it and I think these take-aways (eat healthy as opposed to save\ncalories before social meals, think weekly calorie balance as opposed to last seven\ndays running total, and log between social meals and snacking to get visibility of\ntotal consumption) will help!","9/26/2020":"Very social last few days! Calories went over the last two days but made it up\ntoday :)","9/22/2020":"Cut my thumb today while prepping food for cooking :( -- nothing serious but\nan inconvenience!\n\nOtherwise good day all around :)","9/20/2020":"Hosted guests this weekend and definitely did not eat as healthy! One thing I've\nbeen noticing more and more is that eating things like cake / cheat foods is just\nnot worth it. The satisfaction I get from them is vastly lower than before and\nI know I need to make up for it the following days. This is making me want junk\nless and less.\n\nOn the up-side, compared to previous excess days, this weekend was far lower than\nusual. I definitely feel like the diet is iterating towards getting cleaner and\ncleaner :)","9/13/2020":"Fast day!","9/12/2020":"Housewarming and bday celebration last night! Very very fun! We had three different cakes!! Lots\nof treats too. Knew today was gonna be a big one in terms of calories. Will make\nup for the excess on Sunday.","9/7/2020":"Solid day. Love how doing the simple things makes the rest of the day feel good :)","9/6/2020":"Very social weekend! Calories were def over. Started dating again and realize\nthat I don't want to do the whole alcohol + food thing. Un-neccesary calories,\ndrunchies, and feeling sluggish the next day is no fun. Already updated my\nprofiles to reflect the distate for alcohol :)","9/4/2020":"Made shrimp for the first time yesterday! Came out pretty good. Had leftovers\nso finished them up today. One thing I've noticed is when I have bigger meals\n(like today breakfast was bigger) I feel sluggish after and then have hunger\ncravings sooner (maybe it's because I have less focus -> giving into distraction)\nWill try having \"meals\" not be as large","9/2/2020":"We back on track :)","9/1/2020":"Solid day! Back on the groceries life :)","8/31/2020":"Another off day in terms of diet -- but now we have proper groceries! Will be\nback on tracking tomorrow :)","8/30/2020":"Oof, went overboard on the calories today. We were moving today so wasn't able\nto really eat properly. Had a small brunch and then worked at a cafe for the\nafternoon until dinner. After dinner just had some sugar cravings and gave in.\nI think I'll not worry about making up for excess calories last two days and try\nto get back to normal. May start doing pro-active fasts later this week to build\nup caloric deficencies ahead of time as a buffer for dinners with friends. This\nway I don't need to correct in a reactive way","8/29/2020":"Bit of sporadic day, eating times were far spread apart which definitely lead\nto more calories, but oh well!","8/28/2020":"Half-fast today! Making up for previous day excess. One thing that's definitely\nnice about the logging is it makes excess / defciences very visible. This\nenables action. Like in this case since I over-ate yesterday will \"under-eat\" a\nbit today and continue as normal tomorrow!","8/27/2020":"Had some Ethopian food with friends tonight. Sooooo yummy. Calories were definitely\nover but oh well. Can make it up tomorrow","8/26/2020":"Another chill day. Energy levels felt good, workout felt good. Reading-filled day :)","8/25/2020":"Chill day. Made eggs again today, so yummy. Makes me think more and more about\nbeing meal-centric. Perhaps I can work towards doing something like eggs in AM,\ndeli-wrap for lunch, and then proper dinner. It is nice to snack a bit mid day\nas a break between work and for re-fueling. But perhaps with more meal-centric\nfood will have less need to snack","8/24/2020":"Another day of 2x workouts! Energy felt good for most of day. Home cooking / good\nmacros makes a difference!","8/23/2020":"Dinner was delicious. Tried cooking the tomatoes and cucumbers with the chicken\nand frozen veggies. Came out wonderful. There's something I really enjoy about\nhome cooking.\n\nOverall productive day. Lots of reading and 2x workouts (3+ hours total!)","8/22/2020":"Lower energy day. Tried getting through trevor's workout but was feeling tired.\nLikely due to the fasting from previous day + lots of hookah (almost every other\nday for the last few weeks now). Will start limiting smoking amount","8/21/2020":"Fasted for most of the day to make up for excess calories! Had decent energy\nthroughout the day and even got in two workouts! Was definitely tempted to eat\nin the evening but managed to stay strong!","8/20/2020":"Another big calorie day. Walked/biked all over NYC apartment hunting. Got some\nyummy NYC staples. Street food, shake shack, and local gelato, nom nom","8/16/2020":"Lots of calories today! Had an epic dinner with some friends. Definitely went overboard but oh well, I enjoyed it :)","8/15/2020":"Action packed day! 7mi bike ride, 10k steps from exploring, and jiu-jitsu in the\nevening. Visited my sis and her bf and had lunch and sweets together. Happy to\nbe keeping calories in check","8/12/2020":"Noticed I've been snacking more lately and especially eating lots of the chocolate\nalmonds. Will try to get more meal centric. Trevor had a good suggestion to get\na water jug too -- I think this is a good idea for hitting the 8 cups / water a\nday goal.\n\nNew feature added too -- now including trend data for weight!","8/11/2020":"Stayed up a bit late last night so was a bit lower energy. However\nfinished up Export Health! with Stopa which felt great. Got some Jiu Jitsu in\nthe evening as well. Calories came in a bit lower today and honestly could\nfeel it in my workout. I remarked on this yesterday but yea, I want to be\nmore on top of drinking water. I'm also trying to incoporate more stretching\nand new foods recommended by Trevor.\n\nI guess there's a been a lot of new stuff incoporated lately. Hanging with people\nmore, eating out more often, running outside, training Jiu-Jitsu, stretching. Doing\nlots of new things can feel like a chore, so maybe if I'm feeling like it's getting\ntoo annoying I can cut back on something (maybe replace some workouts with stretch + runs?).\nWill feel this out.\n\nOverall though solid day, really proud of Export Health!, happy to be doing\nJiu-Jitsu again, and happy to be eating clean.","8/10/2020":"After a culinary weekend back to some home cooking. Felt nice to home food again.\nNoticed I haven't been as good about drinking 8 cups of water last week. Will try\nto be on top of this up again -- I really do think the extra water = extra energy","8/9/2020":"Met up with some friends in the evening and had some yummy dinner!","8/8/2020":"Today was a full-day hang! Met up with a buddy Jon for some delicious Goergian food\nand NYC roaming followed by Jiu-Jitsu and homemade tacos with our buddy Jan. Fun day!","8/7/2020":"Was working most of day and didn't make time for proper meals so did more snacking. Kept the snacking\nthough mostly protein/fats related. In the evening went out with friends for Thai food!","8/4/2020":"2nd day of freedom! Had some K-BBQ w/ friends. Still a bit excess on calories, but\nensured to plan better for going out. Also, first run today, felt amazing","8/3/2020":"First day of freedom! Got to meet up with some friends and have some street foods!\nCalories definitely added up, but wow >20k steps from all the exploring :)","8/2/2020":"Was a bit lower energy today so caloried up. Was low calories yesterday so balances yet. Excited to go exploring tomorrow!","8/1/2020":"Made a few tweaks to the site! Added water and weight tracking to entries.\nTwo weeks ago I also added swiping (left/right) on mobile when previewing\nentries and keyboard shortcuts (left/right/esc/x) on desktop.","7/19/2020":"Today was a travel day and make-up for yesterday's excess!","7/18/2020":"Another huge calorie day. Was hanging/celebrating with friends. Ate ~2400cals\nalone from snacking in the evening. Had I reigned this in, would have been within\ncalorie targets across the two days\n\nCelebrating is good, but gotta be more on top of excess in these situations!","7/17/2020":"Mini fast in the evening to prepare for a magic evening!","7/15/2020":"Ended up fasting almost the entire day to make up for the excess intake the\nprevious day. Was over-full for most of the day so this was easy to do. Felt\nmuch better after going on a run. Ate a few dates before doing a second workout.\nFelt great by end of day. Back to regular eating tomorrow!","7/14/2020":"Calories were wayyy overboard today.\n\nHad late dinner with friends which resulted in going over 2000 calories target.\nCalorie total was only around 2250 though so not a huge amount over initially.\nHowever I ended up \"tilting\" and going \"all out\" afterwards. No bueno. Will keep\nin mind that just because I went a little over doesn't mean I should tilt."} };
