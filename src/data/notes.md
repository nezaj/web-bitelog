Was a bit lower energy today so caloried up. Was low calories yesterday so balances yet. Excited to go exploring tomorrow!

Made a few tweaks to the site! Added water and weight tracking to entries.
Two weeks ago I also added swiping (left/right) on mobile when previewing
entries and keyboard shortcuts (left/right/esc/x) on desktop.

Today was a travel day and make-up for yesterday's excess!

### 7/18/2020

Another huge calorie day. Was hanging/celebrating with friends. Ate ~2400cals
alone from snacking in the evening. Had I reigned this in, would have been within
calorie targets across the two days

Celebrating is good, but gotta be more on top of excess in these situations!

### 7/17/2020

Mini fast in the evening to prepare for a magic evening!

### 7/15/2020

Ended up fasting almost the entire day to make up for the excess intake the
previous day. Was over-full for most of the day so this was easy to do. Felt
much better after going on a run. Ate a few dates before doing a second workout.
Felt great by end of day. Back to regular eating tomorrow!

Calories were wayyy overboard today.

Had late dinner with friends which resulted in going over 2000 calories target.
Calorie total was only around 2250 though so not a huge amount over initially.
However I ended up "tilting" and going "all out" afterwards. No bueno. Will keep
in mind that just because I went a little over doesn't mean I should tilt.
