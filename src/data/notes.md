### 11/21/2020

Felt a bit heavy last few days so decided to do a fast day today!

### 11/19/2020

So far wisdom teeth recovery has gone well! Started eating cooked food and working out today. Ended up eating lots of grapes today, not sure why, just really wanted
some carbs. Will aim to keep the reminaing days in the green :)

### 11/15/2020

Succeeded with all greens this week! Feels good :)

Was nice to mix in some eating out as well, even fit in an ice cream that worked
with the calories and macros. Worked out everyday and hit almost all my habits
every day this week. I think hitting my habits in addition to clean diet + exercise makes me feel good overall.

Getting some wisdom teeth extracted tomorrow so will be restricted in terms of workout and some eating. Nonethless, let's get another week of all greens in :)

### 11/13/2020

Another clean day :) So far M-F this week has been all greens -- feels good! I've been consistent with all my other habits this week as well. Definitely notice that
consistently eating clean + doing habits results in being more productive and happy. Will keep it green for this weekend as well!

### 11/9/2020

Goals for this week:

-   All greens (no excuses)
-   Wake up 6:45am every day (Sa/Sun included)

Calorie-wise this was the heaviest week since I started logging. Several things happened this week

-   Got tired of cooking every meal so tried ordering out, had a gyro from Halal Guys and a burrito from Chiptole
-   It is actually reasonable to get healthy food from ordering out!
-   However the food is loaded with sodium, so I don't feel as satiated vs. if I cooked at home
-   It was Stopa's bday this week and we celebrated hardcore with Ben and Jerrys -- had ice cream three times this week!
-   I indulged in our catered party food. Ended up eating lots of yummy turkish food, chocolates, and cake.
-   Not sure if this actually impacted anything, curiously though, it was election week, things were stressful in the nation.

I noticed myself making lots of excuses this week. Ice cream for a birthday is reasonable. Trying the food we are serving to our guests is reasonable, etc. It's easy to justify why it's okay to let diet slide, but it really is just an excuse.

I didn't do any Trevor workouts on my own either this week. So in addition to poor diet -- wasn't on top of fitness either. However, I did go to Jiu-Jitsu 2x and it's feeling much easier on my body. Very happy to be back to training.

Last week I wanted to reduce the nuts and dates. Heh I did do that, but indulged in other things. This week I want to reset back to clean diet -- keeping in mind "no excuses". Also, I need to wake up 6:45am on MWF to make it to Jiu-Jitsu. That's definitely early, but I like that by the time I'm done with class and back home I already feel great and it's pretty much the time I was starting to work at before. If I wake up daily 6:45 it will probably be a better schedule than just MWF -- so will try that out!

### 11/2/2020

Gonna start trying to do reviews of the previous week on Mondays. This past week was a bit all over the place. Started the week off after a huge caloric weekend which spilled over a bit to last Monday. For the most part though the excess calories were cleaner. I started training at a Jiu-Jitsu gym this week which definitely led to an increased appetitie. Calories were a bit higher this week but food was relatively clean. Saturday was Halloween and Sunday was Jordan's birthday so indulged in some sweets but was able to make up for it by mostly fasting on Sunday.

Average calories came out to 2126 and macros were 115g protein, 111g fat, 182g carbs. Again weekend/social eating was the biggest offender in terms of diet, although this week was much better. I also notice I've been eating a lot of nuts and sometimes excess dates. Will try to keep both foods to two servings max per day and substitue with more veggies and/or protein -- this should lower calories a bit and make more room for protein.

Looking at the heat-map, calories were not consistent. We have Stopa's birthday this week so may be a challenege to keep things all green -- but will shoot for that anyway :)

### 10/27/2020

Lots of workouts, made up calories from previous days, Today felt like a reset!

### 10/26/2020

Even after that amazing dinner with friends came home and snacked a ton. Resulted
in another day of excess calories.

I also missed Trevor's workouts four days in a row now... time to get back on
schedule!

### 10/25/2020

Oof the late night drunchies hit hard. We also spent the whole day with friends
who cooked delicious food. A gastronmic day overall.

### 10/24/2020

Today was overall lower calories until the evening. Had a date and ended
up drinking a beer, this would set off some serious drunchies after...

### 10/23/2020

Had Georgian food with some friends in the evening! So yummy. Was able to keep
calories mostly in control.

### 10/18/2020

Cleanest week to date :)

### 10/13/2020

Back on track!

### 10/12/2020

Pushed out a few updates!

1. Images are tagged by their "meal group" which is determined based on time between other images (makes the actual groupings)
   and labeled based on time of day (breakfast/lunch/dinner) and total calories of meal group (snack/meal/large meal)
2. Daily trends are now weekly trends amd each data point includes the min, average, and max value for that week
3. New heatmap for showing average intra-day calorie consumption (values are based on last 7 days, last 30 days, etc.)
4. New heatmap for showing daily calories
5. New heatmap for sharing water consumption

Although I'm happy to have pushed this out I didn't make time for actual workouts! ðŸ˜… Let's get back on it :)

### 10/9/2020

Oof, last few days were rough i.e. nutrition. Something about the ice cream from
Sunday set me off and I gave in. Today was a fast to reset and will try to be
mindful about calories for next two days.

Fasting-wise today felt good. Felt minimal hunger, although considering I ate
5k calories yesterday that's not unreasonable.

Pushed an update to group foods together as well! I notice just by looking at
the number of meals and snacks I have in a day I can roughly gauge how clean my
day was. I aim to use this as an indicator to be more meal-centric and less snacky.

### 10/6/2020

Lower cals today to make up for previous day excess. Will lilely do lower cals
tomorrow as well

### 10/5/2020

Was in a bit of a funk over the weekend due to lower calories + odd meal timing.
Indulged in a ton of Ice cream on Sunday which honestly made me feel better. However
I definitely was above 2k cals/day average this week. What a shame, were it not
for the excess ice cream I would have been under! Oh well, new week -- new streak!

That being said, started the week with excess ðŸ˜… Hosted my sister and her boyfriend
for an evening hang today which led to eating some yummy yet sugary snacks.

These excess calories keep happening with evening hangs. My approach so far has
been to simply allow it and then fast the next day to make up for the calories.
This is what I will be doing tomorrow.

I don't know if this pattern is sustainable -- perhaps a better alternative would
be to abstain from the excess calories or budget for it earlier in the day? We'll
be hosting friends again on Wednesday and I think doing a second fast this week
will be annoying. I'll abstain on Wednesday and see how that feels

### 10/2/2020

Yesterday was a bigger calorie day due to hosting friends. Was happy that all the
excess was healthy foods. Made it easier to fast for most of the day. The calories
I had today were all for workout and hookah afterwards (the apple was during
hookah so I don't get light-headed)

### 9/27/2020

A few notes to share:

About today: Another full day hang with friends. Had only one real meal (thai food)
today where I was suuuuuper hungry and definitely had a bigger meal. Because it
was effectively my first / only meal my calories did not go over. However, I was
still hungry so when hosting friends after dinner indulged in some snacking.
Overall was a sporadic eating day

Targets: I've been logging for almost 100 days! My eating target from the onset
was ~2000 cal/day. Looking at this time period, looks like I've actually been
averaging 2050-2100/cal a day. Not too far off from the goal! During this time
period I've also dropped ~10+ lbs, became more consistent with workouts (hit 20 consecutive ring pull-ups today!), and
overall feeling pretty good! I think this calorie range is pretty sustainable
so will keep shooting for average ~2000 cal/day. Looking to get down to ~140lb
morning weight (which translates to be about ~145lb walking around weight)

Thoughts: It's not always easy to eat strictly ~2000 calories a day. I notice
during the weekdays it's easier for me to restrict calories since I'm focused
on work and cook at home. On weekends / social evening it's very easy for calories
to go over. Sometimes it's easy to make healthy choices when going out, but other
times it's much more difficult (for example eating dinner at a pizza place). Also
sometimes when I'm out I want to indulge in a treat (like ice-cream, or trying
canoli for the first time).

I notice as long as my calories aren't too overboard (over 4k) I can simply make up
for the excess by fasting the next day. As a bonus I feel cleansed the day after fasting.Altthough it is a bit emotionally taxing, there is something rejuvenating about fasting. I notice fasting is easier if I ate healthier food before the
excess -- the nutrition keeps me fueled and satiated. Perhaps one take-away is
that even if I'm going to eat out and there are no healthy options -- ensure I
ate healthy food earlier to reduce my excess appetitie and make it easier to
restrict calories the following day.

Furthermore, I'm finding it useful to think of my "calorie balance" on a weekly
basis. My goal Monday - Sunday is to average ~2000 cal/day or 14,000 calories total.
If I kept under the weekly balance then great! If I went over then I start anew
the following Monday. Similarly if I was under my balance does not carry over. I've
been using this approach the last two weeks and like it better than what I was doing
previously of keeping a running tally of the last seven days. Will see if this
sticks.

Finally, although most of the time I'm pretty good about logging -- on social
days there may be longer periods of time where I haven't logged any food. This may
make it easier to go over budget since I don't have a clear idea of how much
I've already eaten. On those occassions, I can try to log between social meals
to get an idea of how many calories I've already consumed (for example, log
calories between pizza and ice cream). This could help curb excess calories or
reduce post-social meal snacking (which sometimes just puts me over budget, like
in the case of this week).

In general I've been pretty good about eating healthy at home. I imagine if I
never went out it would be much more straightforward to hit nutritional targets.
The interesting challenge is meeting those targets while still being social. I think
I'm getting better at it and I think these take-aways (eat healthy as opposed to save
calories before social meals, think weekly calorie balance as opposed to last seven
days running total, and log between social meals and snacking to get visibility of
total consumption) will help!

### 9/26/2020

Very social last few days! Calories went over the last two days but made it up
today :)

### 9/22/2020

Cut my thumb today while prepping food for cooking :( -- nothing serious but
an inconvenience!

Otherwise good day all around :)

### 9/20/2020

Hosted guests this weekend and definitely did not eat as healthy! One thing I've
been noticing more and more is that eating things like cake / cheat foods is just
not worth it. The satisfaction I get from them is vastly lower than before and
I know I need to make up for it the following days. This is making me want junk
less and less.

On the up-side, compared to previous excess days, this weekend was far lower than
usual. I definitely feel like the diet is iterating towards getting cleaner and
cleaner :)

### 9/13/2020

Fast day!

### 9/12/2020

Housewarming and bday celebration last night! Very very fun! We had three different cakes!! Lots
of treats too. Knew today was gonna be a big one in terms of calories. Will make
up for the excess on Sunday.

### 9/7/2020

Solid day. Love how doing the simple things makes the rest of the day feel good :)

### 9/6/2020

Very social weekend! Calories were def over. Started dating again and realize
that I don't want to do the whole alcohol + food thing. Un-neccesary calories,
drunchies, and feeling sluggish the next day is no fun. Already updated my
profiles to reflect the distate for alcohol :)

### 9/4/2020

Made shrimp for the first time yesterday! Came out pretty good. Had leftovers
so finished them up today. One thing I've noticed is when I have bigger meals
(like today breakfast was bigger) I feel sluggish after and then have hunger
cravings sooner (maybe it's because I have less focus -> giving into distraction)
Will try having "meals" not be as large

### 9/2/2020

We back on track :)

### 9/1/2020

Solid day! Back on the groceries life :)

### 8/31/2020

Another off day in terms of diet -- but now we have proper groceries! Will be
back on tracking tomorrow :)

### 8/30/2020

Oof, went overboard on the calories today. We were moving today so wasn't able
to really eat properly. Had a small brunch and then worked at a cafe for the
afternoon until dinner. After dinner just had some sugar cravings and gave in.
I think I'll not worry about making up for excess calories last two days and try
to get back to normal. May start doing pro-active fasts later this week to build
up caloric deficencies ahead of time as a buffer for dinners with friends. This
way I don't need to correct in a reactive way

### 8/29/2020

Bit of sporadic day, eating times were far spread apart which definitely lead
to more calories, but oh well!

### 8/28/2020

Half-fast today! Making up for previous day excess. One thing that's definitely
nice about the logging is it makes excess / defciences very visible. This
enables action. Like in this case since I over-ate yesterday will "under-eat" a
bit today and continue as normal tomorrow!

### 8/27/2020

Had some Ethopian food with friends tonight. Sooooo yummy. Calories were definitely
over but oh well. Can make it up tomorrow

### 8/26/2020

Another chill day. Energy levels felt good, workout felt good. Reading-filled day :)

### 8/25/2020

Chill day. Made eggs again today, so yummy. Makes me think more and more about
being meal-centric. Perhaps I can work towards doing something like eggs in AM,
deli-wrap for lunch, and then proper dinner. It is nice to snack a bit mid day
as a break between work and for re-fueling. But perhaps with more meal-centric
food will have less need to snack

### 8/24/2020

Another day of 2x workouts! Energy felt good for most of day. Home cooking / good
macros makes a difference!

### 8/23/2020

Dinner was delicious. Tried cooking the tomatoes and cucumbers with the chicken
and frozen veggies. Came out wonderful. There's something I really enjoy about
home cooking.

Overall productive day. Lots of reading and 2x workouts (3+ hours total!)

### 8/22/2020

Lower energy day. Tried getting through trevor's workout but was feeling tired.
Likely due to the fasting from previous day + lots of hookah (almost every other
day for the last few weeks now). Will start limiting smoking amount

### 8/21/2020

Fasted for most of the day to make up for excess calories! Had decent energy
throughout the day and even got in two workouts! Was definitely tempted to eat
in the evening but managed to stay strong!

### 8/20/2020

Another big calorie day. Walked/biked all over NYC apartment hunting. Got some
yummy NYC staples. Street food, shake shack, and local gelato, nom nom

### 8/16/2020

Lots of calories today! Had an epic dinner with some friends. Definitely went overboard but oh well, I enjoyed it :)

### 8/15/2020

Action packed day! 7mi bike ride, 10k steps from exploring, and jiu-jitsu in the
evening. Visited my sis and her bf and had lunch and sweets together. Happy to
be keeping calories in check

### 8/12/2020

Noticed I've been snacking more lately and especially eating lots of the chocolate
almonds. Will try to get more meal centric. Trevor had a good suggestion to get
a water jug too -- I think this is a good idea for hitting the 8 cups / water a
day goal.

New feature added too -- now including trend data for weight!

### 8/11/2020

Stayed up a bit late last night so was a bit lower energy. However
finished up Export Health! with Stopa which felt great. Got some Jiu Jitsu in
the evening as well. Calories came in a bit lower today and honestly could
feel it in my workout. I remarked on this yesterday but yea, I want to be
more on top of drinking water. I'm also trying to incoporate more stretching
and new foods recommended by Trevor.

I guess there's a been a lot of new stuff incoporated lately. Hanging with people
more, eating out more often, running outside, training Jiu-Jitsu, stretching. Doing
lots of new things can feel like a chore, so maybe if I'm feeling like it's getting
too annoying I can cut back on something (maybe replace some workouts with stretch + runs?).
Will feel this out.

Overall though solid day, really proud of Export Health!, happy to be doing
Jiu-Jitsu again, and happy to be eating clean.

### 8/10/2020

After a culinary weekend back to some home cooking. Felt nice to home food again.
Noticed I haven't been as good about drinking 8 cups of water last week. Will try
to be on top of this up again -- I really do think the extra water = extra energy

### 8/9/2020

Met up with some friends in the evening and had some yummy dinner!

### 8/8/2020

Today was a full-day hang! Met up with a buddy Jon for some delicious Goergian food
and NYC roaming followed by Jiu-Jitsu and homemade tacos with our buddy Jan. Fun day!

### 8/7/2020

Was working most of day and didn't make time for proper meals so did more snacking. Kept the snacking
though mostly protein/fats related. In the evening went out with friends for Thai food!

### 8/4/2020

2nd day of freedom! Had some K-BBQ w/ friends. Still a bit excess on calories, but
ensured to plan better for going out. Also, first run today, felt amazing

### 8/3/2020

First day of freedom! Got to meet up with some friends and have some street foods!
Calories definitely added up, but wow >20k steps from all the exploring :)

### 8/2/2020

Was a bit lower energy today so caloried up. Was low calories yesterday so balances yet. Excited to go exploring tomorrow!

### 8/1/2020

Made a few tweaks to the site! Added water and weight tracking to entries.
Two weeks ago I also added swiping (left/right) on mobile when previewing
entries and keyboard shortcuts (left/right/esc/x) on desktop.

### 7/19/2020

Today was a travel day and make-up for yesterday's excess!

### 7/18/2020

Another huge calorie day. Was hanging/celebrating with friends. Ate ~2400cals
alone from snacking in the evening. Had I reigned this in, would have been within
calorie targets across the two days

Celebrating is good, but gotta be more on top of excess in these situations!

### 7/17/2020

Mini fast in the evening to prepare for a magic evening!

### 7/15/2020

Ended up fasting almost the entire day to make up for the excess intake the
previous day. Was over-full for most of the day so this was easy to do. Felt
much better after going on a run. Ate a few dates before doing a second workout.
Felt great by end of day. Back to regular eating tomorrow!

### 7/14/2020

Calories were wayyy overboard today.

Had late dinner with friends which resulted in going over 2000 calories target.
Calorie total was only around 2250 though so not a huge amount over initially.
However I ended up "tilting" and going "all out" afterwards. No bueno. Will keep
in mind that just because I went a little over doesn't mean I should tilt.
