### 5/10/2021

This week averaged 150.3lb weight, ~2555cals/day, lifted 2x, BJJ 3x, ran 1x, did a Muay Thai class, and no Judo. My average weight increased this week over last and my calories were way above target mostly due to eating out with friends. This happened towards the end of the week, for the most of the week I ate pretty clean and consistently which led me to having a great mood. I certainly should have reigned it in when eating out, but I definitely let myself go a bit this week. Maybe I needed it, it's been six week since I started and was potentially feeling some diet stress.

Exercise-wise pretty happy with last week. No Judo was a shame but couldn't fit it in due to social gatherings and wanting to do more BJJ. I will be starting a new schedule this week where I'll be waking up early during the work week. This is to enable a schedule of BJJ 5x a week + Judo 3x a week. Furthermore will still aim for lifting 3x a week (2x a week is guarenteed thanks to training with Trevor, so just need to do one on my own) and reduce running down to 1x.

Coming into this new week I'm feeling strong and energized for workouts. I want this week to be consistent like the beginning of last week, and just more strict about eating out.

### 5/3/2021

Last week was tougher than I thought. I had three red days, three blue days, and one green -- lots of caloric variance. I averaged ~2100/cal per day vs my goal of 1950. This was slightly better than last week. Similarly weight-wise moved down slightly, back to sub 150 terrority, averaging 149.7lb.

Early in the week I felt hungrier and ate excess calories. I tried to offset this in the following days and would eat low calories for most of the day. However, at night I would "crack" and eat a ton. Although late night eating was mostly clean, it meant I again would eat little the following day. This was tough to endure mentally. I was able to mostly offset calories by end of week, but due to eating out with friends, still came in higher than target.

Exercise-wise I lifted 3x, ran 1x, Jiu-Jitsu 2x, and Judo 3x. In addition I biked 4x for 30min-1hr. Overall lots of exercise this week, and the body definitely felt it. I still want to be better about lifting and keep my eye on running -- definitely ran less last week. I spent a lot of time watching BJJ/Judo videos last week so it was tougher to fit in non-class based workouts.

For this week I want to be more mindful about not giving into late-night cravings and keep caloric intake steady. For the month of April I only had one green-dominant week and that was definitely the week I felt the best. Let's get back to that!

### 4/26/2021

This was a pretty wild week for me. Very social and lots of eating out (4x this week). Not a single green day last week — everything was either over or under calories. Overall calories came in around 200 above target. I did lots of BJJ/Judo/Runs so was able to offset excess a bit to bring weight slightly down vs last week.

This week should be much better for the diet since I currently have no dinners planned!

Exercise-wise I ran 3x, BJJ 3x Judo 2x and lifted 2x. Happy about all except lifting — I’ve been doing 2x for most of the last six weeks. Will try to hit 4x this week!

### 4/18/2021

Overall this was a great week in terms of diet! Calories were below target and macros were on-point! Every day was a green or blue day so no excess of calories. Last time I ate this clean was week of Nov 9th (aka 6 months ago). I would say
this primarily due to the fact I had no dinner plans this week so never ate out. Thanks to Snapkitchen + some groceries was easy to eat clean

I also got braces (invisalign) on Tuesday which definitely makes eating / drinking
annoying. On the plus side, this means it will be easier to turn down dinner plans due to the hassle of needing to clean teeth afterwards. Of course I will still do dinners every now and then (we have a birthday dinner coming up for a friend), but
I'm actually happy to have an excuse to turn down spontaenous dinner plans for now.

I did Jiu-Jitsu 5x this week and lifted 3x which was great. However, I did not run Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Went on a run on Sunday, but Sunday is supposed to be test day for workouts, which I'll skip today because I'm pooped. I skipped the runs due to a combination of it being rainy last week + adjusting to braces life. Tl;dr I hope to be more on point with running this week.

I'm checking out a Judo school as well tomorrow -- very excited about that! If I like the school will sign up immediately. Judo is 3x a week and it conflicts with BJJ. However, BJJ is 6x a week. As a result, I'm really gonna try to prioritize doing both BJJ and Judo 3x a week (Judo MWF, BJJ TuThuSa) so 6x a week workouts in addition to running and lifting. There will be exceptions of course (like the birthday dinner) -- but I will make those more rare than in the past with last minute dinner plans. I can also do double classes for BJJ on Tuesday and Saturday (Gi + No-Gi) so will try that this week too!

Let's gooooo!

### 4/11/2021

Shared my six-pack goal with my buddy Jan and he said he wanted to join. We agreed to send each other
weekly reviews so I'm back to writing reflections -- sweet!

I'll reflect on the last two weeks here. Two weeks ago was when I was re-invigorated to wotk towards
the six pack again. The first week went excellent -- my calories were very clean and I only ate out
once. This week I ate out four times, which made it much harder to keep overall calories low. I was
able to offset the excess calories a bit by eating less on the non eating out days, but this certainly
took a mental toll.

I ate out four times due to social gatherings with friends. Although I love seeing my friends, going forward
I will be limiting eating out to no more than twice a week. This means I will be turning down dinner plans. In
the last two weeks I've given up smoking and it's definitely had a positve impact on my fitness and overall
feeling of wellness. I imagine restricting eating out will have similar benefits.

Looking forward to the week ahead!

### 1/3/2021

My eating/fitness was deifnitely not in-line with my overall goals during the holidays.

That being said, the holidays have come and gone and it's now 2021 -- w00t! Time to bring back those good habits :)

**Goals for next week:**

-   Average <= 2,050cals/week
-   Trevor workout 7/7

For my own curiousity I did a quick and dirty analysis of my foods since I started tracking.

Two things stood out to me:

-   11 of the foods are “snacky”, 7 foods are “mealy”, and 2 foods were desert
-   Looks like on average when I ate B&J ice cream I would eat a whole pints worth

Some take-aways

-   Will work on cutting down the average dessert intake. One idea is to introduce more frequent smaller treats. I realize I actually did this for awhile back in August / September with the chocolate almonds and I didn't touch ice cream during that time. Having a little bit of sugar instead of a lot at once is probably better than what I've been doing the last few weeks
-   Will get back into cooking to increase pct of calories that come from "meal-centric" foods. I think bulk cooking will be a huge help for this!

Other thoughts

-   I recorded 6 full day fasts during this time period in addition to a few < 500cal days. Most often these full day fasts were re-active due to an excess the previous day. I believe only once or twice it was a pro-active fast. I actually like fasting because it feels like a cleanse. However I would rather do it more pro-actively than re-actively.
-   For 2021 will try to be better at managing the wild swings to caloric ranges
-   The main offenders for caloric excess seem to fall in the following categories
    -   Gave in to excess eating (e.g. B&J). This became a problem after I stopped buying the chocolate almonds. To counter this will introduce small dessert snacking again.
    -   Eating out in restaurants with friends. In these situations I will try to be mindful of how much and how fast I am eating. I think I should still enjoy my time out with friends, but instead simply eat slower and eat less
    -   Hosting friends and over-snacking. Often times I also want to partake in the snacking. I can try to plan ahead and adjust my caloric so I can indulge. Regardless I should practice mindful eating in those situations. Eat slower and portion out the snacks instead of just grabbing them

Below is the list of the top 20 foods which contributed roughly ~80% of my caloric intake

### 12/15/2020

I missed writing a reflection on Sunday but still wanted to get one in for the
week.

Goals from previous week:

-   (Success, 1 red day) 2 or less red days
-   (Fail, worked-out 3x) Workout all 7 days, following new schedule (VT + runs + test + weekend workouts)
-   (Fail, cooked 2x) Cook food for next day at least 3x
-   (Success, 3x Jiu-Jitsu) Jiu-Jitsu at least 3x

Thoughts for the week

-   Ate clean again M -> TH
-   F -> Su was very social and lots of excess
-   Ate a few home-cooked meals which where great
-   However, wasn't motivated enough to cook more than 2x, it definitely takes some energy to follow-through at night
-   Failed the 7x workout early on, missed both my runs on Tuesday/Thursday mainly because it was hard to wake up early and it was cold outside
-   Although I had only 1 red day, calories were higher on average this week at ~2.25k
-   Was able to hit BJJ 3x which felt great. Ideally will be going 5x but it's hard to make that 7:30am morning class

The beginning of last week started off great, but once the weekend came things went off the rails. We
were very social last weekend, going to the same Georgia restaurant twice and hosting folks. Not only
did this lead to excess calories, but I smoked a lot of hookah and got < 6 hours of sleep 3 nights in
a row. This was very tough on my body and made me let go of my other habits (like writing a reflection).
Thankfully I'm now feeling reset.

Going forward, I want to be more aware of weekend excess. A part of me wanted to let loose, but it was too much. Not
sure how to formulate this goal more concretely yet. One thing I do know though is that I want to cut back on hookah.
Although I'm setting this mid-week, here's my goals for the upcoming week.

-   2 or less red days
-   Run at least 1x, Workout at least 2x F -> Sun
-   Don't smoke hookah more than 2x

In other news, small update to the website -- I added a reflections tab! I've noticed I've been wanting
this for a few weeks now so decided to add it in. I use a hueristic (> X words) to determine what
qualifies as a "reflection" and then collect all my notes that fulfill that criteria and list it on one page.

### 12/6/2020

Thoughts for this week

-   Ate pretty clean M -> TH
-   Got some baked cookies from a friend, was a great gift and indulged a bit.
-   Ate >6K calories on Friday, which was extreme. Ended up just letting go
-   To make up for the extreme excess, I fasted for two days straight, also extreme
-   This week had the largest intra-week weight difference ~6.8lbs.
-   Lowest weight: Monday, 147.8 (post fast from previous week)
-   Highest weight: Saturday, 154.6 (post 6k calories on Friday)
-   Despite extremes, met goal of <2 red days. Also kept average carbs to <200/day
-   Was connected to at least 3 workouts -- but barely.

This was another strange week. Monday -> Thursday were pretty good with solid
workouts on Monday, Wednesday, and doing 100 pull-ups test. Started Jiu-Jitsu again this week which was great.
On Friday however I went to a friend's party and let go. To top it off, I ate
2lbs of ice cream after coming home. This was my biggest calorie day since I started
logging. This also caused a huge (but temporary) increase on the scale, leading to
my largest intra-week weight range. To make up for this I fasted for 2 days straight,
or what came out to be ~55hours between the ice cream and my next meal. Another
record since starting to record.

Despite these extremes happy to say I did meet both my goals last week (although
somewhat barely i.e. working out). I'm glad the goals were more realistic. I want
to push harder on the workout goal so will be more ambitious for next week.

I'm aware we've been ordering out more and more. I prefer not to cook
during the day/afternoon now since it interferes with our working schedule.
We don't eat junk when we do deliviery which is good, But still some of the food
is loaded with sodium and I know that's not optimal for work-outs + Jiu-Jitsu.
Last week I tried cooking in the evening for consumption the following day. This
worked out pretty well and I want to try making this a habit going forward.

I got back on bananas, bread, and sunflower-seed butter this week. I noticed
that eating a carb-centric meal 2-3 hours before working out with Trevor or Jiu-Jitsu
has a positive impact on my energy levels. Previously I would eat a more carb
heavy meal earlier in the day and a protein heavy meal for dinner. Will try
switching it up so that the protein heavy meal is for breakfast/lunch and the carb
loaded meal is for dinner M-F.

For the following week will shoot for these goals.

-   2 or less red days
-   Workout all 7 days, following new schedule (VT + runs + test + weekend workouts)
-   Cook food for next day at least 3x
-   Jiu-Jitsu at least 3x

### 11/29/2020

Quick thoughts for this week

-   Thanksgiving week turned out to be a doozy in terms of diet and fitness.
-   Ate pretty clean Monday -> Wednesday
-   Thursday -> Saturday was rougher.
-   Ate >4K calories on Thanksgiving, although this was expected
-   Tried fasting for most of Friday, but gave in to cravings and ate cake which lead to >3K calories
-   Fasted for most of Friday but had dinner with friends and then ice cream
-   Successfully fasted full day on Sunday
-   Ended up with 3 green days, 2 red days, and 2 blue days. Did not hit 5+ green days.
-   Overall calories were >2k avg for the week, but not as bad as coudl have been given it was Turkey day week
-   Did not exercise though Thursday -> Sunday.

Looking at my goals from last week, I literally did not hit a single one. Somewhat
disappointing. Reflecting on exercise, I realize I've been getting disconnected
with my workouts. I want to re-connect with them and put more heart into my fitness.

In general I know it's hard for me to break through the 150lb range. I know I can do
it though. I'm feeling pumped.

For this week will try to sit different goals:

-   2 or less red days. Thinking < X red days I think is more realistic than Y green days. Since if a red day does happen, I may want to make up for it with a blue day.
-   Be connected to at least 3 workouts this week. I can evaluate for myself whether I'm truly into my workout.

### 11/22/2020

This was a bit of a strange week. Definitely did not hit all greens. On the positive side, average calories were still <2000.

Overview:

-   Had two wisdom teeth extracted on Monday
-   Could not exercise until Thursday
-   Only worked out twice this week
-   No Jiu-Jitsu
-   Ate delivery 5 / 7 days
-   Lots of carbs/sodium Wednesday onwards
-   Three red days, weight drifted up intra-week
-   Made up for it by fasting
-   Had ice-cream again end-of-week (fit into calories)

Thankfully my wisdom teeth operation was quick and painless and the recovery so far has been pretty easy. Was able to be productive work wise Tuesday onwards.

However, was not able to do Jiu-Jitsu (and won't be able to until Wednesday) and workout as much. I only worked out twice this week (Thursday and Saturday) and overall moved a lot less than usual.

Although my calorie average came out to <2000, there were three red days. My carb + sodium in-take went way up (ate lots of fruits and ate out) Wednesday onwards which resulted in my weight drifting up and feeling bloated. To counter this I did a full-day fast -- which balanced things out.

Next week is turkey day. Will likely have excess calories that day. Will likely make up for the excess on Friday. Will allow a potential excess on Sunday too if it fits in with my calories/macros.

Goals for next week:

-   < 2000 cals/avg
-   < 200 carbs/avg
-   5+ green days
-   Exercise everyday (potential hike on Sunday can count as exercise as well)

### 11/21/2020

Felt a bit heavy last few days so decided to do a fast day today!

### 11/19/2020

So far wisdom teeth recovery has gone well! Started eating cooked food and working out today. Ended up eating lots of grapes today, not sure why, just really wanted
some carbs. Will aim to keep the reminaing days in the green :)

### 11/15/2020

Succeeded with all greens this week! Feels good :)

Was nice to mix in some eating out as well, even fit in an ice cream that worked
with the calories and macros. Worked out everyday and hit almost all my habits
every day this week. I think hitting my habits in addition to clean diet + exercise makes me feel good overall.

Getting some wisdom teeth extracted tomorrow so will be restricted in terms of workout and some eating. Nonethless, let's get another week of all greens in :)

### 11/13/2020

Another clean day :) So far M-F this week has been all greens -- feels good! I've been consistent with all my other habits this week as well. Definitely notice that
consistently eating clean + doing habits results in being more productive and happy. Will keep it green for this weekend as well!

### 11/9/2020

Goals for this week:

-   All greens (no excuses)
-   Wake up 6:45am every day (Sa/Sun included)

Calorie-wise this was the heaviest week since I started logging. Several things happened this week

-   Got tired of cooking every meal so tried ordering out, had a gyro from Halal Guys and a burrito from Chiptole
-   It is actually reasonable to get healthy food from ordering out!
-   However the food is loaded with sodium, so I don't feel as satiated vs. if I cooked at home
-   It was Stopa's bday this week and we celebrated hardcore with Ben and Jerrys -- had ice cream three times this week!
-   I indulged in our catered party food. Ended up eating lots of yummy turkish food, chocolates, and cake.
-   Not sure if this actually impacted anything, curiously though, it was election week, things were stressful in the nation.

I noticed myself making lots of excuses this week. Ice cream for a birthday is reasonable. Trying the food we are serving to our guests is reasonable, etc. It's easy to justify why it's okay to let diet slide, but it really is just an excuse.

I didn't do any Trevor workouts on my own either this week. So in addition to poor diet -- wasn't on top of fitness either. However, I did go to Jiu-Jitsu 2x and it's feeling much easier on my body. Very happy to be back to training.

Last week I wanted to reduce the nuts and dates. Heh I did do that, but indulged in other things. This week I want to reset back to clean diet -- keeping in mind "no excuses". Also, I need to wake up 6:45am on MWF to make it to Jiu-Jitsu. That's definitely early, but I like that by the time I'm done with class and back home I already feel great and it's pretty much the time I was starting to work at before. If I wake up daily 6:45 it will probably be a better schedule than just MWF -- so will try that out!

### 11/2/2020

Gonna start trying to do reviews of the previous week on Mondays. This past week was a bit all over the place. Started the week off after a huge caloric weekend which spilled over a bit to last Monday. For the most part though the excess calories were cleaner. I started training at a Jiu-Jitsu gym this week which definitely led to an increased appetitie. Calories were a bit higher this week but food was relatively clean. Saturday was Halloween and Sunday was Jordan's birthday so indulged in some sweets but was able to make up for it by mostly fasting on Sunday.

Average calories came out to 2126 and macros were 115g protein, 111g fat, 182g carbs. Again weekend/social eating was the biggest offender in terms of diet, although this week was much better. I also notice I've been eating a lot of nuts and sometimes excess dates. Will try to keep both foods to two servings max per day and substitue with more veggies and/or protein -- this should lower calories a bit and make more room for protein.

Looking at the heat-map, calories were not consistent. We have Stopa's birthday this week so may be a challenege to keep things all green -- but will shoot for that anyway :)

### 10/27/2020

Lots of workouts, made up calories from previous days, Today felt like a reset!

### 10/26/2020

Even after that amazing dinner with friends came home and snacked a ton. Resulted
in another day of excess calories.

I also missed Trevor's workouts four days in a row now... time to get back on
schedule!

### 10/25/2020

Oof the late night drunchies hit hard. We also spent the whole day with friends
who cooked delicious food. A gastronmic day overall.

### 10/24/2020

Today was overall lower calories until the evening. Had a date and ended
up drinking a beer, this would set off some serious drunchies after...

### 10/23/2020

Had Georgian food with some friends in the evening! So yummy. Was able to keep
calories mostly in control.

### 10/18/2020

Cleanest week to date :)

### 10/13/2020

Back on track!

### 10/12/2020

Pushed out a few updates!

1. Images are tagged by their "meal group" which is determined based on time between other images (makes the actual groupings)
   and labeled based on time of day (breakfast/lunch/dinner) and total calories of meal group (snack/meal/large meal)
2. Daily trends are now weekly trends amd each data point includes the min, average, and max value for that week
3. New heatmap for showing average intra-day calorie consumption (values are based on last 7 days, last 30 days, etc.)
4. New heatmap for showing daily calories
5. New heatmap for sharing water consumption

Although I'm happy to have pushed this out I didn't make time for actual workouts! 😅 Let's get back on it :)

### 10/9/2020

Oof, last few days were rough i.e. nutrition. Something about the ice cream from
Sunday set me off and I gave in. Today was a fast to reset and will try to be
mindful about calories for next two days.

Fasting-wise today felt good. Felt minimal hunger, although considering I ate
5k calories yesterday that's not unreasonable.

Pushed an update to group foods together as well! I notice just by looking at
the number of meals and snacks I have in a day I can roughly gauge how clean my
day was. I aim to use this as an indicator to be more meal-centric and less snacky.

### 10/6/2020

Lower cals today to make up for previous day excess. Will lilely do lower cals
tomorrow as well

### 10/5/2020

Was in a bit of a funk over the weekend due to lower calories + odd meal timing.
Indulged in a ton of Ice cream on Sunday which honestly made me feel better. However
I definitely was above 2k cals/day average this week. What a shame, were it not
for the excess ice cream I would have been under! Oh well, new week -- new streak!

That being said, started the week with excess 😅 Hosted my sister and her boyfriend
for an evening hang today which led to eating some yummy yet sugary snacks.

These excess calories keep happening with evening hangs. My approach so far has
been to simply allow it and then fast the next day to make up for the calories.
This is what I will be doing tomorrow.

I don't know if this pattern is sustainable -- perhaps a better alternative would
be to abstain from the excess calories or budget for it earlier in the day? We'll
be hosting friends again on Wednesday and I think doing a second fast this week
will be annoying. I'll abstain on Wednesday and see how that feels

### 10/2/2020

Yesterday was a bigger calorie day due to hosting friends. Was happy that all the
excess was healthy foods. Made it easier to fast for most of the day. The calories
I had today were all for workout and hookah afterwards (the apple was during
hookah so I don't get light-headed)

### 9/27/2020

A few notes to share:

About today: Another full day hang with friends. Had only one real meal (thai food)
today where I was suuuuuper hungry and definitely had a bigger meal. Because it
was effectively my first / only meal my calories did not go over. However, I was
still hungry so when hosting friends after dinner indulged in some snacking.
Overall was a sporadic eating day

Targets: I've been logging for almost 100 days! My eating target from the onset
was ~2000 cal/day. Looking at this time period, looks like I've actually been
averaging 2050-2100/cal a day. Not too far off from the goal! During this time
period I've also dropped ~10+ lbs, became more consistent with workouts (hit 20 consecutive ring pull-ups today!), and
overall feeling pretty good! I think this calorie range is pretty sustainable
so will keep shooting for average ~2000 cal/day. Looking to get down to ~140lb
morning weight (which translates to be about ~145lb walking around weight)

Thoughts: It's not always easy to eat strictly ~2000 calories a day. I notice
during the weekdays it's easier for me to restrict calories since I'm focused
on work and cook at home. On weekends / social evening it's very easy for calories
to go over. Sometimes it's easy to make healthy choices when going out, but other
times it's much more difficult (for example eating dinner at a pizza place). Also
sometimes when I'm out I want to indulge in a treat (like ice-cream, or trying
canoli for the first time).

I notice as long as my calories aren't too overboard (over 4k) I can simply make up
for the excess by fasting the next day. As a bonus I feel cleansed the day after fasting.Altthough it is a bit emotionally taxing, there is something rejuvenating about fasting. I notice fasting is easier if I ate healthier food before the
excess -- the nutrition keeps me fueled and satiated. Perhaps one take-away is
that even if I'm going to eat out and there are no healthy options -- ensure I
ate healthy food earlier to reduce my excess appetitie and make it easier to
restrict calories the following day.

Furthermore, I'm finding it useful to think of my "calorie balance" on a weekly
basis. My goal Monday - Sunday is to average ~2000 cal/day or 14,000 calories total.
If I kept under the weekly balance then great! If I went over then I start anew
the following Monday. Similarly if I was under my balance does not carry over. I've
been using this approach the last two weeks and like it better than what I was doing
previously of keeping a running tally of the last seven days. Will see if this
sticks.

Finally, although most of the time I'm pretty good about logging -- on social
days there may be longer periods of time where I haven't logged any food. This may
make it easier to go over budget since I don't have a clear idea of how much
I've already eaten. On those occassions, I can try to log between social meals
to get an idea of how many calories I've already consumed (for example, log
calories between pizza and ice cream). This could help curb excess calories or
reduce post-social meal snacking (which sometimes just puts me over budget, like
in the case of this week).

In general I've been pretty good about eating healthy at home. I imagine if I
never went out it would be much more straightforward to hit nutritional targets.
The interesting challenge is meeting those targets while still being social. I think
I'm getting better at it and I think these take-aways (eat healthy as opposed to save
calories before social meals, think weekly calorie balance as opposed to last seven
days running total, and log between social meals and snacking to get visibility of
total consumption) will help!

Very social last few days! Calories went over the last two days but made it up
today :)

### 9/22/2020

Cut my thumb today while prepping food for cooking :( -- nothing serious but
an inconvenience!

Otherwise good day all around :)

### 9/20/2020

Hosted guests this weekend and definitely did not eat as healthy! One thing I've
been noticing more and more is that eating things like cake / cheat foods is just
not worth it. The satisfaction I get from them is vastly lower than before and
I know I need to make up for it the following days. This is making me want junk
less and less.

On the up-side, compared to previous excess days, this weekend was far lower than
usual. I definitely feel like the diet is iterating towards getting cleaner and
cleaner :)

### 9/13/2020

Fast day!

### 9/12/2020

Housewarming and bday celebration last night! Very very fun! We had three different cakes!! Lots
of treats too. Knew today was gonna be a big one in terms of calories. Will make
up for the excess on Sunday.

### 9/7/2020

Solid day. Love how doing the simple things makes the rest of the day feel good :)

### 9/6/2020

Very social weekend! Calories were def over. Started dating again and realize
that I don't want to do the whole alcohol + food thing. Un-neccesary calories,
drunchies, and feeling sluggish the next day is no fun. Already updated my
profiles to reflect the distate for alcohol :)

### 9/4/2020

Made shrimp for the first time yesterday! Came out pretty good. Had leftovers
so finished them up today. One thing I've noticed is when I have bigger meals
(like today breakfast was bigger) I feel sluggish after and then have hunger
cravings sooner (maybe it's because I have less focus -> giving into distraction)
Will try having "meals" not be as large

### 9/2/2020

We back on track :)

### 9/1/2020

Solid day! Back on the groceries life :)

### 8/31/2020

Another off day in terms of diet -- but now we have proper groceries! Will be
back on tracking tomorrow :)

### 8/30/2020

Oof, went overboard on the calories today. We were moving today so wasn't able
to really eat properly. Had a small brunch and then worked at a cafe for the
afternoon until dinner. After dinner just had some sugar cravings and gave in.
I think I'll not worry about making up for excess calories last two days and try
to get back to normal. May start doing pro-active fasts later this week to build
up caloric deficencies ahead of time as a buffer for dinners with friends. This
way I don't need to correct in a reactive way

### 8/29/2020

Bit of sporadic day, eating times were far spread apart which definitely lead
to more calories, but oh well!

### 8/28/2020

Half-fast today! Making up for previous day excess. One thing that's definitely
nice about the logging is it makes excess / defciences very visible. This
enables action. Like in this case since I over-ate yesterday will "under-eat" a
bit today and continue as normal tomorrow!

### 8/27/2020

Had some Ethopian food with friends tonight. Sooooo yummy. Calories were definitely
over but oh well. Can make it up tomorrow

### 8/26/2020

Another chill day. Energy levels felt good, workout felt good. Reading-filled day :)

### 8/25/2020

Chill day. Made eggs again today, so yummy. Makes me think more and more about
being meal-centric. Perhaps I can work towards doing something like eggs in AM,
deli-wrap for lunch, and then proper dinner. It is nice to snack a bit mid day
as a break between work and for re-fueling. But perhaps with more meal-centric
food will have less need to snack

### 8/24/2020

Another day of 2x workouts! Energy felt good for most of day. Home cooking / good
macros makes a difference!

### 8/23/2020

Dinner was delicious. Tried cooking the tomatoes and cucumbers with the chicken
and frozen veggies. Came out wonderful. There's something I really enjoy about
home cooking.

Overall productive day. Lots of reading and 2x workouts (3+ hours total!)

### 8/22/2020

Lower energy day. Tried getting through trevor's workout but was feeling tired.
Likely due to the fasting from previous day + lots of hookah (almost every other
day for the last few weeks now). Will start limiting smoking amount

### 8/21/2020

Fasted for most of the day to make up for excess calories! Had decent energy
throughout the day and even got in two workouts! Was definitely tempted to eat
in the evening but managed to stay strong!

### 8/20/2020

Another big calorie day. Walked/biked all over NYC apartment hunting. Got some
yummy NYC staples. Street food, shake shack, and local gelato, nom nom

### 8/16/2020

Lots of calories today! Had an epic dinner with some friends. Definitely went overboard but oh well, I enjoyed it :)

### 8/15/2020

Action packed day! 7mi bike ride, 10k steps from exploring, and jiu-jitsu in the
evening. Visited my sis and her bf and had lunch and sweets together. Happy to
be keeping calories in check

### 8/12/2020

Noticed I've been snacking more lately and especially eating lots of the chocolate
almonds. Will try to get more meal centric. Trevor had a good suggestion to get
a water jug too -- I think this is a good idea for hitting the 8 cups / water a
day goal.

New feature added too -- now including trend data for weight!

### 8/11/2020

Stayed up a bit late last night so was a bit lower energy. However
finished up Export Health! with Stopa which felt great. Got some Jiu Jitsu in
the evening as well. Calories came in a bit lower today and honestly could
feel it in my workout. I remarked on this yesterday but yea, I want to be
more on top of drinking water. I'm also trying to incoporate more stretching
and new foods recommended by Trevor.

I guess there's a been a lot of new stuff incoporated lately. Hanging with people
more, eating out more often, running outside, training Jiu-Jitsu, stretching. Doing
lots of new things can feel like a chore, so maybe if I'm feeling like it's getting
too annoying I can cut back on something (maybe replace some workouts with stretch + runs?).
Will feel this out.

Overall though solid day, really proud of Export Health!, happy to be doing
Jiu-Jitsu again, and happy to be eating clean.

### 8/10/2020

After a culinary weekend back to some home cooking. Felt nice to home food again.
Noticed I haven't been as good about drinking 8 cups of water last week. Will try
to be on top of this up again -- I really do think the extra water = extra energy

### 8/9/2020

Met up with some friends in the evening and had some yummy dinner!

### 8/8/2020

Today was a full-day hang! Met up with a buddy Jon for some delicious Goergian food
and NYC roaming followed by Jiu-Jitsu and homemade tacos with our buddy Jan. Fun day!

### 8/7/2020

Was working most of day and didn't make time for proper meals so did more snacking. Kept the snacking
though mostly protein/fats related. In the evening went out with friends for Thai food!

### 8/4/2020

2nd day of freedom! Had some K-BBQ w/ friends. Still a bit excess on calories, but
ensured to plan better for going out. Also, first run today, felt amazing

### 8/3/2020

First day of freedom! Got to meet up with some friends and have some street foods!
Calories definitely added up, but wow >20k steps from all the exploring :)

### 8/2/2020

Was a bit lower energy today so caloried up. Was low calories yesterday so balances yet. Excited to go exploring tomorrow!

### 8/1/2020

Made a few tweaks to the site! Added water and weight tracking to entries.
Two weeks ago I also added swiping (left/right) on mobile when previewing
entries and keyboard shortcuts (left/right/esc/x) on desktop.

### 7/19/2020

Today was a travel day and make-up for yesterday's excess!

### 7/18/2020

Another huge calorie day. Was hanging/celebrating with friends. Ate ~2400cals
alone from snacking in the evening. Had I reigned this in, would have been within
calorie targets across the two days

Celebrating is good, but gotta be more on top of excess in these situations!

### 7/17/2020

Mini fast in the evening to prepare for a magic evening!

### 7/15/2020

Ended up fasting almost the entire day to make up for the excess intake the
previous day. Was over-full for most of the day so this was easy to do. Felt
much better after going on a run. Ate a few dates before doing a second workout.
Felt great by end of day. Back to regular eating tomorrow!

### 7/14/2020

Calories were wayyy overboard today.

Had late dinner with friends which resulted in going over 2000 calories target.
Calorie total was only around 2250 though so not a huge amount over initially.
However I ended up "tilting" and going "all out" afterwards. No bueno. Will keep
in mind that just because I went a little over doesn't mean I should tilt.
