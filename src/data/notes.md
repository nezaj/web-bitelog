### 1/2/2022

Weight: I feel like it’s trending down. This week didn’t even have my usual BJJ and Judo so I expect next week to push lower. Overall feeling good

Nutrition: Chia seeds, olive oil, and cheese did the trick to for getting my fats up. No sugar or binges either. A little bit of excess on NYE, but nothing major. Calories may be a bit high overall for the week, but I felt good energy wise. Will try to have a lower overall intake for next week. But will interesting to see how energy feels as I go back to BJJ and Judo

Exercise: No BJJ or Judo due to holidays, but was able to get 3x lifting this week. First time in over a month I lifted this much which felt great. Excited to work towards 120 sessions in 2022

Energy: Energy was okay -> good. Was getting back from being sick and feeling more like my usual self!

Sleep: Lots of sleep! Maybe even too much. All is well

Stress: Stress was low!

Overall: I’m happy with this week. I’m now three weeks in a row of no sweets or late night excess eating. Body is feeling clean

Goals:
* Keep eating clean, try to  keep weekly average to <2150 calories
* Lift 3x, BJJ 3x, Judo 3x

### 12/26/2021

Weight: Not much to say since I was sick.

Nutrition: Ate well but didn’t record since I was sick. Was planning to backfill but got too behind. In the future will be more deliberate about when I don’t log for one day and make sure I don’t skip 2x in a row unless circumstances prevent me

Exercise: Was only able to do one walk this week. Most of the time was spent in bed this week

Energy: Also very low

Sleep: Lots of sleep throughout the day, couldn’t get much continuous sleep at night due to sickness. Finally able to get full sleep by the weekend

Stress: Very low

Overall: Lost week due to sickness, but I think I’m over the sickness now!

Goals:

* Get back to tracking and diet as usual
* BJJ/Judo is closed this week so will do lifts and runs


### 12/19/2021

Weight: Looks like I crossed the 150 line for real. Definitely stinks, but it’s all good. I’m looking to turn this around :)

Nutrition: One of the best weeks I’ve had cals / macros wise in a long time. No excess sugar or late night binges. Had only one day of excess due to overdoing nuts

Exercise: Worked out everyday except Sunday since I was sick

Energy: Energy was definitely lower. I think again actually sticking to calories for the first time in awhile was a minor shock. I also started feeling sick Saturday night and had to spend the whole Sunday recovering

Sleep: I started waking up very early a couple days to do morning Jiu-Jitsu. As a result my sleep was less a few days, will try to adjust to new sleeping schedule in the new year

Stress: Stress was low but I could tell I was feeling off a bit from sugar cravings, was able to fend it off though

Overall: Despite the road bumps with low energy and sickness, I think I’m back on track with nutrition

Goals:

* Stay within 2k average cals, hit my protein, and try to get a little more fats into the diet (noticed it was on lower end for most days)
* Try to do BJJ/Judo assuming not sick anymore. From the 24th onwards classes are paused until the new year so will hit some lifts instead

### 12/13/2021

Weight: Only had one weigh-in so not much to say. But my weight has definitely crept up on me these 8 weeks. Time to turn the trend around

Nutrition: Was visiting family last week. Tried to be good for a day, but then let go for the following days. By the end of my visit I was motivated to fix the trend

Exercise: I didn’t log everything while I was visiting family but I went on walks and/or runs everyday. Overall though less movement than usual because no access to Jiu-Jitsu / Judo. Although I realize in the future can bring my Jiu-Jitsu gi with me when visiting family

Energy: Energy was impacted due to poor diet. Felt sluggish due to the excess carbs and fats

Sleep: Lots of sleep which was nice, needed the recovery since my body was feeling beat up

Stress: I relaxed a lot with my family so low stress.

Overall: I think this week took me to the limit in terms of excess. I’m ready for a change

Goals:

* No binges this week
* Daily movement for at least 60 minutes each day

### 12/06/2021

Weight: It’s tough to see it go up

Nutrition: Definitely gave in to late night eating again. Made me sloppy on logging too. Did fasts to offset, but very disordered

Exercise: Was still able to get movement in most days which helped keep me sane

Energy: After the days of overeating at night my energy is bad in the mornings. Need to correct the eating to fix the energy

Sleep: I think I’ve been oversleeping. I be been using the curtain in my bedroom but it seems to be too effective at blocking the light. Will switch back to stop using it

Stress: Pretty low !

Overall: Not a great week diet wise. Really want to reverse course as my weight has drifted up far beyond what so wanted. Weight of 150 is appearing more often which is way above my goal

Goals: This week will be visiting family so it’s going to be unclear how clean I can eat. On the plus side there should be much less junk eating at night. Will try to get walks and runs in while at my parents


### 11/29/2021

Weight: I skipped most weigh-ins this week because I decided to take a “break” from Wednesday onwards

Nutrition: I was on a break, but definitely overdid it. Useful to reflect on for where my current habits are

Exercise: Lots of exercise even though I didn’t log

Energy: Good energy! But in the mornings I felt sluggish due to excess calories from night before

Sleep: Slept a ton! I close the curtains in my room now and it makes a serious difference!

Stress: Low stress! Taking a break and enjoying the thanksgiving holiday was nice

Overall: Wasn’t my best week, but I learned some stuff for me. Feeling refreshed

Goals:

* Get back to logging, get back to target!
* Judo 2x
* BJJ 3x
* Lift 2x

### 11/22/2021

Weight: Weight continues to drift up. Last few weeks I wasn’t worried about it but now that’s been 4x weeks in a row I’m taking note. I gave in to late night snacking and that definitely caused the scale to be higher

Nutrition: This week was off due to the following:
* Overdid it on the low calorie snacks
* Binged on the weekend with cookies and ice cream (did not log on the weekend either)

Exercise: Tons of BJJ and Judo which was awesome but taxing on the body. No lifting though which was a bummer

Energy: Overall it was neutral / lower maybe due to physical stress

Sleep: Great sleep

Stress: Stressed at beginning of week due to work. Stressed at end of week due to BJJ fatigue

Overall: Not my best week, late night snacking and weekend binge was no good

Goals:
* Curb late night snacking
* Reset my mindset for nutrition / avoid binge
* Won’t set any fitness this week. I’ve been wanting to lift more but finding it difficult to motivate myself. BJJ/Judo/Stairmaster feel way more appealing. Will just let myself feel out if I want to lift

### 11/15/2021

Weight: Weight still seems bound between 145-149 which is higher than I want, but I’m feeling good about it. I feel like my habits are getting better, I’m fitting in movement almost every day, and not bingeing so I think the weight will come down eventually.

Nutrition: Another social week. I declared logging bankruptcy on Friday and Saturday since I was on the cabin trip. Didn’t eat clean and snacked on the trip, but compared to my previous binges it was way less calories.

Had little late night eating otherwise which felt great.

Energy:
Energy started off lower but recovered a ton with good sleep and low stress!

Sleep:
Sleep was much better, offloading some of the writing responsibilities was a huge help!

Stress:
Similar with sleep, much less stress this week. I also felt like I got to do more research / fitness reading which was fun!

Overall:
Given that it was hyper social the week went pretty well. In general I’m feeling good about my nutrition and fitness habits.

Goals:
* Continue limiting late night eating unless there is a social dinner
* Keep average below 2100 calories
* Lift 3x this week
* Jiu-Jitsu 4x

### 11/7/2021

Weight: Another wide range. Lots of social events but poor sleep and feeling stress definitely had an impact

Nutrition: I tried to be good! It was tough due to all the social events. Eating low cal alternatives was helpful for satisfying cravings, but I think I overdid it

Energy: Energy was okay  most days but not great

Sleep: Definitely poor. Staying up late to finish readings is not sustainable

Stress: I would say the main stress was associated with poor sleep. There was some stress due to interviewing with YC too

Overall: I tried my best to be nutritionally good this week but with all the social activities, poor sleep, and high stress it was tough

Nutrition Goals:
* Stay within 2k calorie average
* Curb late night eating unless it’s an event
* Limit eating of low-cal / highly processed foods

Fitness Goals:
* Lift 3x
* Jiu-Jitsu 3x

### 11/2/2021

Weight: Feeling good! Last week had food poisoning so weight was artificially lowered. Feels like it’s settling lower now. Was traveling this weekend and didn’t have access to scale one of the days

Nutrition: Lots of good stuff. Biggest thing now is to curb the late night eating. Unless it’s a late dinner, will try to curb eating after 8pm

Wellness: Overall sleep, stress, and energy were good!

Overall: Week two went well. Looking forward to week three!

Goals: Main focus this week — curb late night eating

### 10/23/2021

Weight: Weight started moving down again! Part of this was due to food poisoning though which wasn’t great

Nutrition: Much better. No binges, lots of protein, getting things back on track

Sleep: Sleep was good enough, definitely need to be getting 7+ hours

Stress: Stress is better than last week. Running Consistent and getting our guys results is still a concern

Overall: First week went well, aside from food poisoning. Exercise was a miss though and would love to get back to daily movement

Nutrition Goals:

-   Keep average calories below target
-   Continue being mindful with food

### 9/22/2021

Weight: Only three weigh-ins this week -- mainly due to poor eating! I definitely didn't want to face the scale. Even with the three weigh-ins, my average weight was the highest in the last three months. Looking at my weight ranges for the last month, I've definitely been stalling. Let's do a full reset

Nutrition: This week saw my highest single calorie day of the year (nearly ~7k) and highest weekly average. 5 / 7 days were red -- which is pretty excessive, I don't think I've had a single one of these since starting logging. The prior week was my birthday and that definitely loosened me up. Let's turn this around and get a full-on target week

Exercise: My one saving grace, another exercise-filled week. Averaged 2hrs/day this week again. This whole month has been great on exercise. The month prior I was averaging a little over 60min a day, but now I'm fitting in 2x workouts consistently.

Sleep / Stress: Lots of parties and events this week + poor eating contributed to disorderly sleep. Would end up taking more naps during the day. Hoping to fix this by getting back to target calories.

Overall: In terms of nutrition, this was one of my poorest weeks to date. In terms of exercise, it was one of my best. I'm happy to be meeting target exercise everyday week over week now for the last month. Let's do the same for nutrition (both calories and protein). I want to work towards triple greens (7/7 target calories, protein, and exercise)

Goals for next week:

-   7 / 7 calories
-   5+ protein
-   7 / 7 exercise

### 9/14/2021

Weight: Weight started low this week post 60hr fast and settled around the 145 area. I wish I was further along, but considering some of the excess I've had over the month or so I'm happy I've somewhat maintained my weight. I definitely want to push it lower. Happy though I'm back on the daily weigh-ins. Scale anxiety can be real and I'm glad I'm facing it. There's something interesting about waking up excited to weigh yourself because you know you did a good job the night before. On the other hand, it can be dreadful to do the morning weigh-in when you know you ate excess previously.

Nutrition: Last review I called out not eating PB standalone. Definitely did not deliver on this. A lot of my calories come from PB, if I kept it to just having it in shakes would be a major caloric reduction that I could replace with less caloric dense food. I had one "excellent" day this week which was Wednesday where I had 3 full meals and a snack. This is what I want to emulate as much as I can.

Exercise: Tons of exercise this week which probably mitigated some of the excess damage. Still no strength training, not sure how I want to fit those in. I do want to do more BJJ as well. Would love to get in a routine of going to bed early and working out 2x a day (morning + evening). Doing this I could fit in BJJ 5x week and strength training 3x.

Sleep / Stress: Was my birthday week and very social towards the weekend. But overall not feeling stressed. Was getting less sleep though which made the mornings tougher. Would be great to establish a better night-time routine

Overall: This week felt better than the previous week, but due to things like my birthday and social events, calories were a bit erratic. Biggest offender remains PB, I think fixing that will be a huge win.

Goals for next week:

-   Nutrition: Reduce eating PB as a standalone food
-   Habit: Keep up with fasting timer, it's been useful!
-   Habit: Drink water instead of giving into cravings at night
-   Exercise: Try to get at 2 morning workouts in during the week -- let's build up this habit!

### 9/6/2021

Last three weeks have been in-consistent. It's time to get back on top of things. Will roll-up three weeks of reviews into one since I missed my previous two unfortunately due to work / moving. Missing one review is a yellow flag, missing two took it to red status. Time to turn things around!

Weight: These last three weeks were filled with scale anxiety where I missed 7 / 7 weigh-ins. I'm back to the routine now, been doing weigh-ins daily since Tuesday and got 6 / 7 this week. Will be sure to hit 7 / 7 next week. Over the last three weeks my weight-range has been all over the place. This is mainly due to a combination of social activity and late-night eating. Looking to get a handle on things again by going back to taking photos of everything I eat and using a fasting timer.

Nutrition: Similar to weight, nutrition has been spotty the last several weeks. Again I chalk this up to in-consistency in some key habits. Took on an extended fast this week to help myself reset. I had two insights over the last week -- when I'm feeling evening cravings, I realize this isn’t for food, this is likely due to dehydration. Instead of eating I should drink water, and ultimately stick with fasting timer. Also, I shouldn't eat PB as a snack, rather only as part of protein shake.

Exercise: Although weigh-ins / nutrition were bad, lots of movement the last few weeks. The good was that I've been fitting in BJJ/Judo/Cardio, the bad is that there has been little strength training. This following week let's try to get back to 3x lifting. As an aside, I've been intentionally doing walks / bike-rides for days where I can't fit in a proper workout -- this has been a win and I'm happy I've been keeping this up.

Sleep / Stress: Although there have been some late social nights these last few weeks, sleep has been pretty good. Still much stress related to working and moving, but I don't feel like it's been overwhelming. For the most part don't think there was much stress related eating. I've been good about letting things go and pro-actively getting in movement to help me relax.

Overall: The last five weeks were not as good as my previous five. I was sloppy with habits and entered the danger zone. I was skipping weigh-ins, not writing reviews, not using my fasting timer, not taking photos of everything I eat, and even declared logging bankruptcy for two days. I'm ready to turn things around. Kicked off an extended fast over the weekend to help myself reset and get centered. Excited to execute in the coming week :)

Goals for next week:

-   Daily weigh-ins
-   6 / 7 target nutrition days (my birthday is on Thursday, will try to stay in target but will give myself some space)
-   7 / 7 movement days

Things to keep in mind:

-   Take photos of everything I eat, this makes me more mindful and make better decisions
-   Use the fasting timer, it's a big help in staying within target nutrition
-   Evening cravings are likely due to dehydration. Don't indulge in food, drink water
-   Don’t eat PB as a stand-alone snack, eat it only as part of a protein shake

### 8/19/2021

Weight: Last week I saw my largest weight range -- and this week it was even larger. I went up as high as 149.2lbs -- nearly a 2lb top weight increase. Weight was coming down the whole week and then escalated quickly Saturday and Sunday morning. My cousing was visiting from Friday onwards so we had late dinners and snacks throughout. It shows in the scale

Nutrition: This was my most in-consistent week to date. Three red days and a blue day at the beginning of the week. Calories were 500+ above target, and protein was 5% below target. Basically this week and last week were both bad weeks nutrition-wise, and I would say this is mainly due to all the social activity.

Exercise: I fit in more exercise this week than last, but less Judo and Jiu-Jitsu which was a bummer. Again missed clases due to all the social activity.

Sleep/Stress: Sleep was better this week and was stress. I started explicitly tracking stress in Streaks so I should have visibility on this going forward. Some "invisible" stress I've been having is feeling anxious about fitting in work, six-pack, Judo/Jiu-Jitsu, and friends.

Overall: This was another tough week. The social activities are fun but I'm feeling anxious about not delivering in other aspects -- especially in the six-pack goal. I want us to do a great job with Consistent and make an amazing business out of it -- but a part of that also involves making sure I get the six-pack and get the results that we want for others. I'm feeling motivated to double-down again on fitness. This week I really want to prioritize eating right and getting in my workouts. I'm happy during the week I have no social obligations so it will allow me to reset.

Goals for this week:

-   Re-vitalize fitness focus. Have one of my best weeks to date
-   0 excess days
-   3x Strength Training

Additional notes:

-   I feel like I've been "falling behind" on my personal Consistent fitness. I'm logging food to MFP later and have been late with my reviews twice in a row now. These are "yellow flags" to me that things are going off the rails. I want to be timely with my logging and review this week
-   I notice that sometimes when I'm running errands I want to "treat" myself to a pastry or snack, something around 200-300 calories. I don't think this is neccesarily bad, but I do feel like I may be over-indulging at times. I'm trying to be more mindful of eating more meals at home rather than out
-   Going cold turkey on weed has resulted in me going "all out" when I have the option to indulge on the weekend. Instead I want to experiment with allowing myself to have gummies and simply track it. So far I've avoided munchies 3/3 times, so perhaps this is more sustainable. I do something similar with ice cream -- now that I allow myself it time to time I'm content with one scoop. Let's see if this actually works.

### 8/10/2021

Weight: I had my largest intra-week weight range this past week, ranging from 141.2lbs -> 147.4lbs. At the start of the week I was getting back into my routine so weight came down fast as expected. However from Wednesday onwards we the week was very social and there were a two excess days on Thursday and Saturday. I also had a date on Friday which resulted in some dirnking and ultimately lead to my top weigh-in at 147.4lbs.

Nutrition: Average calories came out higher this week at 2531 vs 2182. My low/target/excess day split was a bit worse too, with two excess days. Similarly, my macro split had less protein and more carbs and fat. The main cause of the excess was due to hosting friends Thursday night. I let myself go and indulged in double portions + cake, calories came out to 4.5k that day. I also overate on Saturday due to feeling run down, but those calories were mostly clean.

Exercise: Lots of exercise this week, but strength training was a fail. We hosted a friend from Wednesday onwards and that really disrupted my normal flow. Fiting in exercise outside of Judo/Jiu-Jitsu was tough in combination with work.

Sleep/Stress: I want to start being more mindful about sleep/stress. My sleep has been getting worse the last few weeks as I've been feeling more stressed with getting things done with work, fitting in fitness, and being social. Balancing everything is both fun and stressful. Having a friend over this week made it much harder to get things done for Consistent and I was feeling guilty about that. It also threw off my morning exercise schedule so I felt bad about not delivering on my strength training. I was saved by still making it to Judo/Jiu-Jitsu and fitting in a couple of late-night coding sessions. All of this came at the expense of sleep, which probably built up some more stress too. Was feeling run-down on Saturday so caloried up, which was a big help. Our friend is taking off Tuesday morning so I'm looking to get back into the normal routine.

Overall: This was a tough week mentally and it manifested in the large weight range. I'm thankful I was still able to fit movement in and eat nutriously for the most part. This week I have a friend dinner on Tuesday, a date on Wednesday, and my cousin visiting from Friday -> Sunday. Although that's a lot of social things, it feels like it will be much easier this week.

Goals for this week:

-   0 excess days
-   3x Strength Training
-   Start tracking stress

### 8/1/2021

This week was better than last. 5/7 green days, with a red day and a blue day, averaging out to 2182cal/day vs 2843cals/day last week. This was still above my target of 2000 cals per day. The main offender was due to my over-excitement with a the protein ice-cream. It's delicious and nutritious, but I was curious about experimenting with various combinations and over-indulged a bit. My macros were still pretty good though, and I averaged 150g of protein per day.

It was interesting to have a "light" day this week. After eating 3k calories on Wednesday I just had very little appetite the next day. I personally don't like having large variability in calories -- easy for things to go off the rails. But sometimes you need to listen to your body -- and I think the lower calories the next day was a nice reset.

It was also nice to eat clean over the weekend -- my weight did not jump up this weekend which was nice. Although my average weight this week went up vs last week, I feel a downward trend coming.

Lots of exercise this week, but I missed one day, so came out to 6 / 7. That day I worked a lot so skipped both morning and evening workouts. Indeed I find it tricky to balance work, fitness, and being social. Often I con only do 2 / 3 really well. I feel like my fitness was a bit off the last two weeks, and I want to lean into this more.

I want to re-affirm my original "why." I've wanted a six-pack since I was 15. This is the last item on my before 30 bucket list. The six-pack requires planning, commitment, execution, and consistency. There are times where it will be tough, I want to perservere and morph myself into the person. The deeper reason I want this six-pack is because I want to overcome myself.

Some changes I want to make to re-invigorate my goal:

-   Get back on using my fasting timer -- I've been slacking on that and snacking a bit at night.
-   I'm committing to getting morning strength training in on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday this week. I can miss a morning workout, but ideally I will make that decision the day before. When skipping a workout, I will commit in advance to do it another day.
-   Remove processed drinks. I don't drink soda, but I've been indulging in lower calorie drinks. I think these are secretly adding up

These are small changes in addition to my goal for 7 / 7 target + exercise days. If I do all of these I will be super proud, and this will be my best week to date. Feeling pumped!

### 7/25/2021

Whereas last week was my best to date -- this one was my worst. 5/7 green days, averaged 2843cals per day (vs 2000 cals target) with only 22% coming from protein. This miss is entirely due to large excess on Friday and Saturday post birthday parties. I did lots of exercise though with 3x Jiu-Jitsu, lifting, cardio, and 2x Judo. I originally wanted to do 4x lifting, but because of the caloric excess I piled on the cardio. By end of week my average weight stayed the same as the previous week, with my highs/lows staying roughly the same as well.

Reviewing these last two red days and my three red days in previous weeks, they all have one thing in common. I smoked weed. For the remaining 8 weeks I will cut out weed completely. If I feel like I want unwind at a party I can drink instead. I rarely finish even one beer so from a caloric standpoint, one beer is much better than the damage done from munchies.

Let's turn things around this week and get that average weight lower! Goals for next week:

-   7/7 green days
-   7/7 movement days (exercise or walking/biking for at least 1hr)
-   Lift 4x

### 7/18/2021

This was my best week to date. 7/7 green days, averaged 2000cals per day (vs 2317cals last week) and met my exercise goal of lifting 3x (in addition to Judo/Jiu-Jitsu). Macros were better too, with carbs coming in at 228g (vs 270g last week), which is still a little high. This week my average weight was higher, coming in at 143.9lb (vs 143.5lb) but both my top weight and lowest weight were lower this week, so directionally I'm feeling good!

This was one of my most social weeks as well, and really tested me to stick within calorie budgets. I had to abstain from eating with friends on two occasions. I think some people found it strange, but I could tell others respected the discpline. I notice I'm feeling more comfortable with this lifestyle around others.

Exercise-wise I lifted/Judo/Jiu-Jitsu 3x each -- the most exercise I've done in three weeks! Really happy to have gotten the lifting in, and I want to do even more for next week!

Reviewing my diet, I realized my carbs have been coming in higher due to some excess in fruit. The main offender is the amount of grapes and cherries I eat in one sitting, usually 10oz at a time, which is double the calories/carbs of strawberries/apples. An easy fix is to just cut the grapes/cherries portion in half and eat an extra egg instead -- this should move me much closer to the 40/30/30 split.

Overall happy about this week and pumped to do even better for next week!

Goals for next week:

-   7/7 green days again
-   Replace 1/2 grapes/cherries with an egg (closer to 40/30/30)
-   Lift 4x (1 more than last week)

### 7/11/2021

This week was better than last! Almost perfect, 6/7 days were green and macros for those days were on point!, but went off the rails Saturday night. Averaged 2317cals per day (vs 2358cals last week). Carbs came in lower at 270g (vs 300g last week) but still high due to the excess. My average weight came out to 143.5 this week, a 1.6lb drop from last week (vs 1.5lb drop last week).

On my way home from a party on Saturday I walked into a convenience store with the intent of buying some fruit to satiate some late night munchies. I saw a bag of frosted animal circus cookies which I craved the week before. I told myself I could have some and do a double cardio workout on Sunday. What actually happened was I ate the whole bag and although I went hard on the Stairmaster on Sunday, I knew if I did 2x again I would blow out my legs, so I kept the workout to 1hr.

All the other days were pretty clean. Even though I had other social activities throughout the week, I was able to budget in some ice cream and dinners with friends while still keeping macros and calories at target. I am happy with my improvement over last week, and I think just one more mental adjustment will get me to 7/7 green days again.

Aside from excess, looking at the quality of my diet now vs where it was months ago is a huge improvement. I remember how Trevor would mention the importance of meals over snacking. I viscerally feel the difference of the full meal days. My best days have no snacking. Moreoever I see how thinking in terms of meals makes it easier to construct my diet and fuel my workouts.

Exercise-wise 3x Jiu-Jitsu, 2x Judo, 1x Cardio. Did not at all this week which was a fail. I prefer to lift in the morning since I have Judo/Jiu-Jitsu in the evenings. Last week was very busy with running Consistent operationally and coding up tooling. Happy to say I find the work engaging on multiple fronts. However I want to keep an eye on balance, make sure I'm getting in sleep, not burning out, and making time for my own fitness.

This week I commit to the following

-   7/7 green days. I'm going to the beach on Sunday, so I have extra motivation to hit this!
-   Lift at least 3x. I'm happy with my cardio and its time to layer in that resistance training for real. If I get back into the lifitng habit now, 10 weeks from now I should get results that really pop!

### 7/4/2021

This week started off strong, but went off the rails over the weekend. Averaged 2358cals per day, and carbs came out to 300g due to weekend excess. I'm definitely feeling the bloat as I write this. We had a friend bring candy from Israel on Thursday evening and that set in motion a series of excess decisions. Friday night I went to a friends party and also over-indulged into the hunger. I honestly let myself go, and I think if I came in with a plan for both evenings I would have done better.

Monday -> Thursday were pretty clean, but was definitely getting hungry on Thursday. My weight was dropping a ton too, getting as low as 143.4lb. My weekly average weight came out to 145.1lb, which is a 1.5lb drop from last week. This include the heavier weigh-ins on Saturday and Sunday following the excess days. So although some poor decisions were made, I should be on track for the six pack. Will do better next week!

Exercise-wise 3x Lifting, 2x Cardio, 1x BJJ/Judo. Was definitely a bummer that I didn't get to fit more training. Was busy with work and social activities and had to skip classes. I started using FitnessAI for lifting at the gym and it's been great. Takes all the hassle out of planning / recording workouts. The app itself feels fun, and I look forward to the workouts. On Saturday and Sunday I did 2x cardio to help make up for the nights beforehand. I think doing more exercise to help offset extra calories is a good strategy for me.

Goal for next week: Let's get 7/7 green days!

### 6/27/2021

This was a great week. Averaged 1983cals/day and macros were on point. All seven days were green days despite eating out twice. Planning ahead made a big difference, by knowing ahead of time I was eating out I was able to budget calories appropriately. For the days I ate in, eating two snapkitchens a day (with fruit + protein) and a protein shake has fulfilled my calorie/macro targets and kept me satiated.

Most of the days where I ate in two meals of snapkitchen with fruit and protein (yogurt or eggs) and a third meal of a protein shake.

Exercise-wise 3x Lifting/Judo, 2x Jiu-Jitsu. Little bit less than last week, and only 6/7 days exercised. This was mainly due to increased amount of work this week. It's been very exciting launching Consistent and the reality is it's been a bit harder to fit the workouts in. At the same time my body may have needed the rest. Overall though I love the volume of workouts I'm doing and want to do more. I even made an "ideal" schedule this week outlining 4x Lift, 3x Judo, 3x Gi BJJ, 3x No-Gi BJJ, 1x Yoga. This may not be realistic week over week, but aiming for it seem pretty fun.

Ever since we started working on Consistent my fitness has much more on-point. The data speaks for itself, this week I logged both my lowest weight since starting joelogs over a year ago, weighing in at 144.4lb twice this week, and my lowest average weekly weight at 146.5lb. My bodyfat scale put me at 13.5%, crossing below the 14% bodyfat threshold for my first time in years.

Goal for next week is to basically repeat my performance this week. And for myself try to fit in some more BJJ!

### 6/20/2021

Overall would say this was a solid week. Calories averaged higher, 2351, but this was mainly due to one day of excess calories. This was the day when we had guests with us and we are out twice and had snacks afterwards.

The rest of the week I was able to stay green while having other social events. I’m doing a better job of planning ahead and making healthier choices with social events. Will try to keep this up in the coming weeks!

Exercise-wise was more than last two weeks, 4x BJJ, 2x Judo/Lifting/Yoga. Exercised 7/7 of the days!

Weight-wise logged my lowest average weight to date — 147.1lb

One thing I notice is that by not “making up” for the excess of one day it makes it easier to be consistent for the others. Instead of yo-yoing between red/blue, staying green keeps me sharp and in a good mood. This does mean my weekly average suffers, but if I can focus on making good choices on a daily basis, and coming to peace with off days, I think this will be better for long term success.

Onwards!

### 6/18/2021

Late review! This has been happening more often than not lately. Will try to be mindful and ensure to do these reviews on time by Sunday/Monday going forward!

I logged 6/7 days for an average of 1894cals per day. Exercise-wise was a lighter week with 2x Judo/Lift, 1x Jiu-Jitsu/Run. This was mainly due to having more social activities and YC interview early in the week taking up my evening workout time. Should be back to normal workout schedule next week. I was much better about avoiding excess calories with social eating this week! Had dinner with a friend on Wednesday and a party on Saturday but was able to stay within calorie budget. We also had friends staying with us starting from Sunday where I didn't log but calories weren't too bad. Weight-wise this was my lowest average for the week since I started tracking -- 149lbs!

Overall I feel like I'm making great progress. To do even better, I want to be mindful and not lose my consistency with some habits. I wasn't 7/7 logging or on-time with my review two weeks in a row. Let's change that!

### 6/6/2021

Averaged 2027cals last week, but only logged for 5/7 days. This is because I visited family in Boston for a big celebration on the weekend, and didn't bother to log. I indulged in BBQ and cake and definitely overdid it a bit. I realize I associate excess eating with family but it doesn't have to be this way. Next time I go to a family event I'll be more mindful about how I would normally eat and try to replicate that.

For the rest of the days I ate really clean and consistent. A big motivator is that Stopa and I want to make our startup around getting people six packs. From my own attempts so far, I know for sure being consistent in making good eating choices would make the biggest difference for me. I could be better about exercise and sleep, but honestly, if I didn't indulge in the late night treats and the excess eating with friends / family I would have achieved this a long time ago. Doing this startup is extra motivation.

Another thing that really helped this week is using a fasting timer app. The app I'm using itself isn't great, but what's nice is that it makes me more mindful each day when I start and stop eating. I start the timer after having my last planned calories for the day. On pressing the button, I'm making a comittment to not eat any more calories until the next morning. When I do press the button to begin the next day it feels rewarding. Now if I want to grab some food at night, I have a little added friction in that I must stop my timer. This alone has been pretty effective so far in not making indulge. I didn't even need to reach out for my SOS app.

Workout wise it was a lighter week. 2x BJJ/Lift and 1x Judo. No running. The less workouts was mostly due to us fleshing out the idea and prepping for our YC interview. Will still be pushing hard on YC stuff next week, but should be back to normal workout the week after.

Overall ate clean during the week, didn't log during the weekend but that should be a one-off, next time will be more mindful about eating with family (although the damage wasn't too bad). Working on Consistent is definitely a big motivator for the six-pack so super excited for the upcoming weeks!

### 5/30/2021

This week was an improvement over last week. Averaged 2345cals, 3x lifting, 2x BJJ/Jduo/Running. My calories were still over my target, but overall I felt much more stable this week.

I had two red days due to social events. I still need to be better about that. One difference this week is that I didn't try as hard to "make up" for my excess eating. This made me feel more stable throughout the week and gave me good energy for my workouts.

This was also the first week I lifted 3x in awhile. Made me realize I need to get back on the daily lifting. Although it's been nice to focus on BJJ/Judo, I've seen lots of skill improvements, I think I want to go back to focusing more on physique. For this week Stopa and I are gonna be focusing on YC interview so will not start daily workouts yet, but will keep this in mind.

For next week will shoot to keep calories below 2100 average. I also want at least 5 green days again. Let's do this!

### 5/26/2021

Last week was ruff as well. Averaged 2570cals, 2x of BJJ+Judo+Lifting, 1x Running. Was still recovering a bit for sickness and back to 100% on Wednesday. We had people over on Tuesday which lead to major overage and then I just let myself go on the weekend. I had two weigh-ins at 150.2 and 151.2 -- so weight is drifting up again!!

As I'm writing this reflection for last week on Wednesday, I notice I have again eaten excess calories when having friends over (yesterday). I think in general I'm being too lax with the diet. As I'm now starting week 9 of 20 of my six pack goal, it's really time to get serious again

### 5/17/2021

This was a tough week, was sick from Wednesday onwards (still a little sick today). Didn't get around to weighing myself once. Averaged ~2661cals/day (well above 2000cals/day target). I lifted, judo-d, and jiu-jitsued 1x, and ran 2x. Basically from Wednesday onwards I took it easy with just a couple bike rides and one run. I let myself go Saturday night after Stopa brought home some cookies -- ate two pints of ben and jerrys and several oreos. I haven't done that in awhile, I think I was fed up with being sick and trying to stick with diet goals. I ate excess calories earlier in the week and was doing a good job offsetting it, but the hunger/stress caught up with me. Offsetting excess definitely takes a toll.

I also discovered towards the end of the week I've been under-estimating my peanut butter and dates calories -- resulting in under-reporting anywhere between 300-800 calories each day. I discovered this by 1. Using an actual tablespoon to measure a PB serving and realizing I was eating roughly 2x the amount and 2. Looking closer at the nutritional information of the dates and realizing it was ~2x calories I thought. Going forward will adjust my PB/date intake accordingly. I've also noticed that my caloric is roughly 40% carbs, 40% fats, 20% protein. I want to move this more to 40% carbs, 30% fats, and 30% protein (or roughly 200C, 75F, 150P for 2k calories). A simple adjustment to help achieve this would be to replace one of my regular PB servings with greek yogurt, so will be doing that too.

As of today (Monday) I'm still a little sick but feeling good to workout! Let's get back on the healthy train :)

### 5/10/2021

This week averaged 150.3lb weight, ~2555cals/day, lifted 2x, BJJ 3x, ran 1x, did a Muay Thai class, and no Judo. My average weight increased this week over last and my calories were way above target mostly due to eating out with friends. This happened towards the end of the week, for the most of the week I ate pretty clean and consistently which led me to having a great mood. I certainly should have reigned it in when eating out, but I definitely let myself go a bit this week. Maybe I needed it, it's been six week since I started and was potentially feeling some diet stress.

Exercise-wise pretty happy with last week. No Judo was a shame but couldn't fit it in due to social gatherings and wanting to do more BJJ. I will be starting a new schedule this week where I'll be waking up early during the work week. This is to enable a schedule of BJJ 5x a week + Judo 3x a week. Furthermore will still aim for lifting 3x a week (2x a week is guarenteed thanks to training with Trevor, so just need to do one on my own) and reduce running down to 1x.

Coming into this new week I'm feeling strong and energized for workouts. I want this week to be consistent like the beginning of last week, and just more strict about eating out.

### 5/3/2021

Last week was tougher than I thought. I had three red days, three blue days, and one green -- lots of caloric variance. I averaged ~2100/cal per day vs my goal of 1950. This was slightly better than last week. Similarly weight-wise moved down slightly, back to sub 150 terrority, averaging 149.7lb.

Early in the week I felt hungrier and ate excess calories. I tried to offset this in the following days and would eat low calories for most of the day. However, at night I would "crack" and eat a ton. Although late night eating was mostly clean, it meant I again would eat little the following day. This was tough to endure mentally. I was able to mostly offset calories by end of week, but due to eating out with friends, still came in higher than target.

Exercise-wise I lifted 3x, ran 1x, Jiu-Jitsu 2x, and Judo 3x. In addition I biked 4x for 30min-1hr. Overall lots of exercise this week, and the body definitely felt it. I still want to be better about lifting and keep my eye on running -- definitely ran less last week. I spent a lot of time watching BJJ/Judo videos last week so it was tougher to fit in non-class based workouts.

For this week I want to be more mindful about not giving into late-night cravings and keep caloric intake steady. For the month of April I only had one green-dominant week and that was definitely the week I felt the best. Let's get back to that!

### 4/26/2021

This was a pretty wild week for me. Very social and lots of eating out (4x this week). Not a single green day last week — everything was either over or under calories. Overall calories came in around 200 above target. I did lots of BJJ/Judo/Runs so was able to offset excess a bit to bring weight slightly down vs last week.

This week should be much better for the diet since I currently have no dinners planned!

Exercise-wise I ran 3x, BJJ 3x Judo 2x and lifted 2x. Happy about all except lifting — I’ve been doing 2x for most of the last six weeks. Will try to hit 4x this week!

### 4/18/2021

Overall this was a great week in terms of diet! Calories were below target and macros were on-point! Every day was a green or blue day so no excess of calories. Last time I ate this clean was week of Nov 9th (aka 6 months ago). I would say
this primarily due to the fact I had no dinner plans this week so never ate out. Thanks to Snapkitchen + some groceries was easy to eat clean

I also got braces (invisalign) on Tuesday which definitely makes eating / drinking
annoying. On the plus side, this means it will be easier to turn down dinner plans due to the hassle of needing to clean teeth afterwards. Of course I will still do dinners every now and then (we have a birthday dinner coming up for a friend), but
I'm actually happy to have an excuse to turn down spontaenous dinner plans for now.

I did Jiu-Jitsu 5x this week and lifted 3x which was great. However, I did not run Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Went on a run on Sunday, but Sunday is supposed to be test day for workouts, which I'll skip today because I'm pooped. I skipped the runs due to a combination of it being rainy last week + adjusting to braces life. Tl;dr I hope to be more on point with running this week.

I'm checking out a Judo school as well tomorrow -- very excited about that! If I like the school will sign up immediately. Judo is 3x a week and it conflicts with BJJ. However, BJJ is 6x a week. As a result, I'm really gonna try to prioritize doing both BJJ and Judo 3x a week (Judo MWF, BJJ TuThuSa) so 6x a week workouts in addition to running and lifting. There will be exceptions of course (like the birthday dinner) -- but I will make those more rare than in the past with last minute dinner plans. I can also do double classes for BJJ on Tuesday and Saturday (Gi + No-Gi) so will try that this week too!

Let's gooooo!

### 4/11/2021

Shared my six-pack goal with my buddy Jan and he said he wanted to join. We agreed to send each other
weekly reviews so I'm back to writing reflections -- sweet!

I'll reflect on the last two weeks here. Two weeks ago was when I was re-invigorated to wotk towards
the six pack again. The first week went excellent -- my calories were very clean and I only ate out
once. This week I ate out four times, which made it much harder to keep overall calories low. I was
able to offset the excess calories a bit by eating less on the non eating out days, but this certainly
took a mental toll.

I ate out four times due to social gatherings with friends. Although I love seeing my friends, going forward
I will be limiting eating out to no more than twice a week. This means I will be turning down dinner plans. In
the last two weeks I've given up smoking and it's definitely had a positve impact on my fitness and overall
feeling of wellness. I imagine restricting eating out will have similar benefits.

Looking forward to the week ahead!

### 1/3/2021

My eating/fitness was deifnitely not in-line with my overall goals during the holidays.

That being said, the holidays have come and gone and it's now 2021 -- w00t! Time to bring back those good habits :)

**Goals for next week:**

-   Average <= 2,050cals/week
-   Trevor workout 7/7

For my own curiousity I did a quick and dirty analysis of my foods since I started tracking.

Two things stood out to me:

-   11 of the foods are “snacky”, 7 foods are “mealy”, and 2 foods were desert
-   Looks like on average when I ate B&J ice cream I would eat a whole pints worth

Some take-aways

-   Will work on cutting down the average dessert intake. One idea is to introduce more frequent smaller treats. I realize I actually did this for awhile back in August / September with the chocolate almonds and I didn't touch ice cream during that time. Having a little bit of sugar instead of a lot at once is probably better than what I've been doing the last few weeks
-   Will get back into cooking to increase pct of calories that come from "meal-centric" foods. I think bulk cooking will be a huge help for this!

Other thoughts

-   I recorded 6 full day fasts during this time period in addition to a few < 500cal days. Most often these full day fasts were re-active due to an excess the previous day. I believe only once or twice it was a pro-active fast. I actually like fasting because it feels like a cleanse. However I would rather do it more pro-actively than re-actively.
-   For 2021 will try to be better at managing the wild swings to caloric ranges
-   The main offenders for caloric excess seem to fall in the following categories
    -   Gave in to excess eating (e.g. B&J). This became a problem after I stopped buying the chocolate almonds. To counter this will introduce small dessert snacking again.
    -   Eating out in restaurants with friends. In these situations I will try to be mindful of how much and how fast I am eating. I think I should still enjoy my time out with friends, but instead simply eat slower and eat less
    -   Hosting friends and over-snacking. Often times I also want to partake in the snacking. I can try to plan ahead and adjust my caloric so I can indulge. Regardless I should practice mindful eating in those situations. Eat slower and portion out the snacks instead of just grabbing them

Below is the list of the top 20 foods which contributed roughly ~80% of my caloric intake

### 12/15/2020

I missed writing a reflection on Sunday but still wanted to get one in for the
week.

Goals from previous week:

-   (Success, 1 red day) 2 or less red days
-   (Fail, worked-out 3x) Workout all 7 days, following new schedule (VT + runs + test + weekend workouts)
-   (Fail, cooked 2x) Cook food for next day at least 3x
-   (Success, 3x Jiu-Jitsu) Jiu-Jitsu at least 3x

Thoughts for the week

-   Ate clean again M -> TH
-   F -> Su was very social and lots of excess
-   Ate a few home-cooked meals which where great
-   However, wasn't motivated enough to cook more than 2x, it definitely takes some energy to follow-through at night
-   Failed the 7x workout early on, missed both my runs on Tuesday/Thursday mainly because it was hard to wake up early and it was cold outside
-   Although I had only 1 red day, calories were higher on average this week at ~2.25k
-   Was able to hit BJJ 3x which felt great. Ideally will be going 5x but it's hard to make that 7:30am morning class

The beginning of last week started off great, but once the weekend came things went off the rails. We
were very social last weekend, going to the same Georgia restaurant twice and hosting folks. Not only
did this lead to excess calories, but I smoked a lot of hookah and got < 6 hours of sleep 3 nights in
a row. This was very tough on my body and made me let go of my other habits (like writing a reflection).
Thankfully I'm now feeling reset.

Going forward, I want to be more aware of weekend excess. A part of me wanted to let loose, but it was too much. Not
sure how to formulate this goal more concretely yet. One thing I do know though is that I want to cut back on hookah.
Although I'm setting this mid-week, here's my goals for the upcoming week.

-   2 or less red days
-   Run at least 1x, Workout at least 2x F -> Sun
-   Don't smoke hookah more than 2x

In other news, small update to the website -- I added a reflections tab! I've noticed I've been wanting
this for a few weeks now so decided to add it in. I use a hueristic (> X words) to determine what
qualifies as a "reflection" and then collect all my notes that fulfill that criteria and list it on one page.

### 12/6/2020

Thoughts for this week

-   Ate pretty clean M -> TH
-   Got some baked cookies from a friend, was a great gift and indulged a bit.
-   Ate >6K calories on Friday, which was extreme. Ended up just letting go
-   To make up for the extreme excess, I fasted for two days straight, also extreme
-   This week had the largest intra-week weight difference ~6.8lbs.
-   Lowest weight: Monday, 147.8 (post fast from previous week)
-   Highest weight: Saturday, 154.6 (post 6k calories on Friday)
-   Despite extremes, met goal of <2 red days. Also kept average carbs to <200/day
-   Was connected to at least 3 workouts -- but barely.

This was another strange week. Monday -> Thursday were pretty good with solid
workouts on Monday, Wednesday, and doing 100 pull-ups test. Started Jiu-Jitsu again this week which was great.
On Friday however I went to a friend's party and let go. To top it off, I ate
2lbs of ice cream after coming home. This was my biggest calorie day since I started
logging. This also caused a huge (but temporary) increase on the scale, leading to
my largest intra-week weight range. To make up for this I fasted for 2 days straight,
or what came out to be ~55hours between the ice cream and my next meal. Another
record since starting to record.

Despite these extremes happy to say I did meet both my goals last week (although
somewhat barely i.e. working out). I'm glad the goals were more realistic. I want
to push harder on the workout goal so will be more ambitious for next week.

I'm aware we've been ordering out more and more. I prefer not to cook
during the day/afternoon now since it interferes with our working schedule.
We don't eat junk when we do deliviery which is good, But still some of the food
is loaded with sodium and I know that's not optimal for work-outs + Jiu-Jitsu.
Last week I tried cooking in the evening for consumption the following day. This
worked out pretty well and I want to try making this a habit going forward.

I got back on bananas, bread, and sunflower-seed butter this week. I noticed
that eating a carb-centric meal 2-3 hours before working out with Trevor or Jiu-Jitsu
has a positive impact on my energy levels. Previously I would eat a more carb
heavy meal earlier in the day and a protein heavy meal for dinner. Will try
switching it up so that the protein heavy meal is for breakfast/lunch and the carb
loaded meal is for dinner M-F.

For the following week will shoot for these goals.

-   2 or less red days
-   Workout all 7 days, following new schedule (VT + runs + test + weekend workouts)
-   Cook food for next day at least 3x
-   Jiu-Jitsu at least 3x

### 11/29/2020

Quick thoughts for this week

-   Thanksgiving week turned out to be a doozy in terms of diet and fitness.
-   Ate pretty clean Monday -> Wednesday
-   Thursday -> Saturday was rougher.
-   Ate >4K calories on Thanksgiving, although this was expected
-   Tried fasting for most of Friday, but gave in to cravings and ate cake which lead to >3K calories
-   Fasted for most of Friday but had dinner with friends and then ice cream
-   Successfully fasted full day on Sunday
-   Ended up with 3 green days, 2 red days, and 2 blue days. Did not hit 5+ green days.
-   Overall calories were >2k avg for the week, but not as bad as coudl have been given it was Turkey day week
-   Did not exercise though Thursday -> Sunday.

Looking at my goals from last week, I literally did not hit a single one. Somewhat
disappointing. Reflecting on exercise, I realize I've been getting disconnected
with my workouts. I want to re-connect with them and put more heart into my fitness.

In general I know it's hard for me to break through the 150lb range. I know I can do
it though. I'm feeling pumped.

For this week will try to sit different goals:

-   2 or less red days. Thinking < X red days I think is more realistic than Y green days. Since if a red day does happen, I may want to make up for it with a blue day.
-   Be connected to at least 3 workouts this week. I can evaluate for myself whether I'm truly into my workout.

### 11/22/2020

This was a bit of a strange week. Definitely did not hit all greens. On the positive side, average calories were still <2000.

Overview:

-   Had two wisdom teeth extracted on Monday
-   Could not exercise until Thursday
-   Only worked out twice this week
-   No Jiu-Jitsu
-   Ate delivery 5 / 7 days
-   Lots of carbs/sodium Wednesday onwards
-   Three red days, weight drifted up intra-week
-   Made up for it by fasting
-   Had ice-cream again end-of-week (fit into calories)

Thankfully my wisdom teeth operation was quick and painless and the recovery so far has been pretty easy. Was able to be productive work wise Tuesday onwards.

However, was not able to do Jiu-Jitsu (and won't be able to until Wednesday) and workout as much. I only worked out twice this week (Thursday and Saturday) and overall moved a lot less than usual.

Although my calorie average came out to <2000, there were three red days. My carb + sodium in-take went way up (ate lots of fruits and ate out) Wednesday onwards which resulted in my weight drifting up and feeling bloated. To counter this I did a full-day fast -- which balanced things out.

Next week is turkey day. Will likely have excess calories that day. Will likely make up for the excess on Friday. Will allow a potential excess on Sunday too if it fits in with my calories/macros.

Goals for next week:

-   < 2000 cals/avg
-   < 200 carbs/avg
-   5+ green days
-   Exercise everyday (potential hike on Sunday can count as exercise as well)

### 11/21/2020

Felt a bit heavy last few days so decided to do a fast day today!

### 11/19/2020

So far wisdom teeth recovery has gone well! Started eating cooked food and working out today. Ended up eating lots of grapes today, not sure why, just really wanted
some carbs. Will aim to keep the reminaing days in the green :)

Succeeded with all greens this week! Feels good :)

Was nice to mix in some eating out as well, even fit in an ice cream that worked
with the calories and macros. Worked out everyday and hit almost all my habits
every day this week. I think hitting my habits in addition to clean diet + exercise makes me feel good overall.

Getting some wisdom teeth extracted tomorrow so will be restricted in terms of workout and some eating. Nonethless, let's get another week of all greens in :)

### 11/13/2020

Another clean day :) So far M-F this week has been all greens -- feels good! I've been consistent with all my other habits this week as well. Definitely notice that
consistently eating clean + doing habits results in being more productive and happy. Will keep it green for this weekend as well!

### 11/9/2020

Goals for this week:

-   All greens (no excuses)
-   Wake up 6:45am every day (Sa/Sun included)

Calorie-wise this was the heaviest week since I started logging. Several things happened this week

-   Got tired of cooking every meal so tried ordering out, had a gyro from Halal Guys and a burrito from Chiptole
-   It is actually reasonable to get healthy food from ordering out!
-   However the food is loaded with sodium, so I don't feel as satiated vs. if I cooked at home
-   It was Stopa's bday this week and we celebrated hardcore with Ben and Jerrys -- had ice cream three times this week!
-   I indulged in our catered party food. Ended up eating lots of yummy turkish food, chocolates, and cake.
-   Not sure if this actually impacted anything, curiously though, it was election week, things were stressful in the nation.

I noticed myself making lots of excuses this week. Ice cream for a birthday is reasonable. Trying the food we are serving to our guests is reasonable, etc. It's easy to justify why it's okay to let diet slide, but it really is just an excuse.

I didn't do any Trevor workouts on my own either this week. So in addition to poor diet -- wasn't on top of fitness either. However, I did go to Jiu-Jitsu 2x and it's feeling much easier on my body. Very happy to be back to training.

Last week I wanted to reduce the nuts and dates. Heh I did do that, but indulged in other things. This week I want to reset back to clean diet -- keeping in mind "no excuses". Also, I need to wake up 6:45am on MWF to make it to Jiu-Jitsu. That's definitely early, but I like that by the time I'm done with class and back home I already feel great and it's pretty much the time I was starting to work at before. If I wake up daily 6:45 it will probably be a better schedule than just MWF -- so will try that out!

### 11/2/2020

Gonna start trying to do reviews of the previous week on Mondays. This past week was a bit all over the place. Started the week off after a huge caloric weekend which spilled over a bit to last Monday. For the most part though the excess calories were cleaner. I started training at a Jiu-Jitsu gym this week which definitely led to an increased appetitie. Calories were a bit higher this week but food was relatively clean. Saturday was Halloween and Sunday was Jordan's birthday so indulged in some sweets but was able to make up for it by mostly fasting on Sunday.

Average calories came out to 2126 and macros were 115g protein, 111g fat, 182g carbs. Again weekend/social eating was the biggest offender in terms of diet, although this week was much better. I also notice I've been eating a lot of nuts and sometimes excess dates. Will try to keep both foods to two servings max per day and substitue with more veggies and/or protein -- this should lower calories a bit and make more room for protein.

Looking at the heat-map, calories were not consistent. We have Stopa's birthday this week so may be a challenege to keep things all green -- but will shoot for that anyway :)

### 10/27/2020

Lots of workouts, made up calories from previous days, Today felt like a reset!

### 10/26/2020

Even after that amazing dinner with friends came home and snacked a ton. Resulted
in another day of excess calories.

I also missed Trevor's workouts four days in a row now... time to get back on
schedule!

### 10/25/2020

Oof the late night drunchies hit hard. We also spent the whole day with friends
who cooked delicious food. A gastronmic day overall.

### 10/24/2020

Today was overall lower calories until the evening. Had a date and ended
up drinking a beer, this would set off some serious drunchies after...

### 10/23/2020

Had Georgian food with some friends in the evening! So yummy. Was able to keep
calories mostly in control.

### 10/18/2020

Cleanest week to date :)

### 10/13/2020

Back on track!

### 10/12/2020

Pushed out a few updates!

1. Images are tagged by their "meal group" which is determined based on time between other images (makes the actual groupings)
   and labeled based on time of day (breakfast/lunch/dinner) and total calories of meal group (snack/meal/large meal)
2. Daily trends are now weekly trends amd each data point includes the min, average, and max value for that week
3. New heatmap for showing average intra-day calorie consumption (values are based on last 7 days, last 30 days, etc.)
4. New heatmap for showing daily calories
5. New heatmap for sharing water consumption

Although I'm happy to have pushed this out I didn't make time for actual workouts! 😅 Let's get back on it :)

### 10/9/2020

Oof, last few days were rough i.e. nutrition. Something about the ice cream from
Sunday set me off and I gave in. Today was a fast to reset and will try to be
mindful about calories for next two days.

Fasting-wise today felt good. Felt minimal hunger, although considering I ate
5k calories yesterday that's not unreasonable.

Pushed an update to group foods together as well! I notice just by looking at
the number of meals and snacks I have in a day I can roughly gauge how clean my
day was. I aim to use this as an indicator to be more meal-centric and less snacky.

### 10/6/2020

Lower cals today to make up for previous day excess. Will lilely do lower cals
tomorrow as well

### 10/5/2020

Was in a bit of a funk over the weekend due to lower calories + odd meal timing.
Indulged in a ton of Ice cream on Sunday which honestly made me feel better. However
I definitely was above 2k cals/day average this week. What a shame, were it not
for the excess ice cream I would have been under! Oh well, new week -- new streak!

That being said, started the week with excess 😅 Hosted my sister and her boyfriend
for an evening hang today which led to eating some yummy yet sugary snacks.

These excess calories keep happening with evening hangs. My approach so far has
been to simply allow it and then fast the next day to make up for the calories.
This is what I will be doing tomorrow.

I don't know if this pattern is sustainable -- perhaps a better alternative would
be to abstain from the excess calories or budget for it earlier in the day? We'll
be hosting friends again on Wednesday and I think doing a second fast this week
will be annoying. I'll abstain on Wednesday and see how that feels

### 10/2/2020

Yesterday was a bigger calorie day due to hosting friends. Was happy that all the
excess was healthy foods. Made it easier to fast for most of the day. The calories
I had today were all for workout and hookah afterwards (the apple was during
hookah so I don't get light-headed)

### 9/27/2020

A few notes to share:

About today: Another full day hang with friends. Had only one real meal (thai food)
today where I was suuuuuper hungry and definitely had a bigger meal. Because it
was effectively my first / only meal my calories did not go over. However, I was
still hungry so when hosting friends after dinner indulged in some snacking.
Overall was a sporadic eating day

Targets: I've been logging for almost 100 days! My eating target from the onset
was ~2000 cal/day. Looking at this time period, looks like I've actually been
averaging 2050-2100/cal a day. Not too far off from the goal! During this time
period I've also dropped ~10+ lbs, became more consistent with workouts (hit 20 consecutive ring pull-ups today!), and
overall feeling pretty good! I think this calorie range is pretty sustainable
so will keep shooting for average ~2000 cal/day. Looking to get down to ~140lb
morning weight (which translates to be about ~145lb walking around weight)

Thoughts: It's not always easy to eat strictly ~2000 calories a day. I notice
during the weekdays it's easier for me to restrict calories since I'm focused
on work and cook at home. On weekends / social evening it's very easy for calories
to go over. Sometimes it's easy to make healthy choices when going out, but other
times it's much more difficult (for example eating dinner at a pizza place). Also
sometimes when I'm out I want to indulge in a treat (like ice-cream, or trying
canoli for the first time).

I notice as long as my calories aren't too overboard (over 4k) I can simply make up
for the excess by fasting the next day. As a bonus I feel cleansed the day after fasting.Altthough it is a bit emotionally taxing, there is something rejuvenating about fasting. I notice fasting is easier if I ate healthier food before the
excess -- the nutrition keeps me fueled and satiated. Perhaps one take-away is
that even if I'm going to eat out and there are no healthy options -- ensure I
ate healthy food earlier to reduce my excess appetitie and make it easier to
restrict calories the following day.

Furthermore, I'm finding it useful to think of my "calorie balance" on a weekly
basis. My goal Monday - Sunday is to average ~2000 cal/day or 14,000 calories total.
If I kept under the weekly balance then great! If I went over then I start anew
the following Monday. Similarly if I was under my balance does not carry over. I've
been using this approach the last two weeks and like it better than what I was doing
previously of keeping a running tally of the last seven days. Will see if this
sticks.

Finally, although most of the time I'm pretty good about logging -- on social
days there may be longer periods of time where I haven't logged any food. This may
make it easier to go over budget since I don't have a clear idea of how much
I've already eaten. On those occassions, I can try to log between social meals
to get an idea of how many calories I've already consumed (for example, log
calories between pizza and ice cream). This could help curb excess calories or
reduce post-social meal snacking (which sometimes just puts me over budget, like
in the case of this week).

In general I've been pretty good about eating healthy at home. I imagine if I
never went out it would be much more straightforward to hit nutritional targets.
The interesting challenge is meeting those targets while still being social. I think
I'm getting better at it and I think these take-aways (eat healthy as opposed to save
calories before social meals, think weekly calorie balance as opposed to last seven
days running total, and log between social meals and snacking to get visibility of
total consumption) will help!

### 9/26/2020

Very social last few days! Calories went over the last two days but made it up
today :)

### 9/22/2020

Cut my thumb today while prepping food for cooking :( -- nothing serious but
an inconvenience!

Otherwise good day all around :)

### 9/20/2020

Hosted guests this weekend and definitely did not eat as healthy! One thing I've
been noticing more and more is that eating things like cake / cheat foods is just
not worth it. The satisfaction I get from them is vastly lower than before and
I know I need to make up for it the following days. This is making me want junk
less and less.

On the up-side, compared to previous excess days, this weekend was far lower than
usual. I definitely feel like the diet is iterating towards getting cleaner and
cleaner :)

### 9/13/2020

Fast day!

### 9/12/2020

Housewarming and bday celebration last night! Very very fun! We had three different cakes!! Lots
of treats too. Knew today was gonna be a big one in terms of calories. Will make
up for the excess on Sunday.

### 9/7/2020

Solid day. Love how doing the simple things makes the rest of the day feel good :)

### 9/6/2020

Very social weekend! Calories were def over. Started dating again and realize
that I don't want to do the whole alcohol + food thing. Un-neccesary calories,
drunchies, and feeling sluggish the next day is no fun. Already updated my
profiles to reflect the distate for alcohol :)

### 9/4/2020

Made shrimp for the first time yesterday! Came out pretty good. Had leftovers
so finished them up today. One thing I've noticed is when I have bigger meals
(like today breakfast was bigger) I feel sluggish after and then have hunger
cravings sooner (maybe it's because I have less focus -> giving into distraction)
Will try having "meals" not be as large

### 9/2/2020

We back on track :)

### 9/1/2020

Solid day! Back on the groceries life :)

### 8/31/2020

Another off day in terms of diet -- but now we have proper groceries! Will be
back on tracking tomorrow :)

### 8/30/2020

Oof, went overboard on the calories today. We were moving today so wasn't able
to really eat properly. Had a small brunch and then worked at a cafe for the
afternoon until dinner. After dinner just had some sugar cravings and gave in.
I think I'll not worry about making up for excess calories last two days and try
to get back to normal. May start doing pro-active fasts later this week to build
up caloric deficencies ahead of time as a buffer for dinners with friends. This
way I don't need to correct in a reactive way

### 8/29/2020

Bit of sporadic day, eating times were far spread apart which definitely lead
to more calories, but oh well!

### 8/28/2020

Half-fast today! Making up for previous day excess. One thing that's definitely
nice about the logging is it makes excess / defciences very visible. This
enables action. Like in this case since I over-ate yesterday will "under-eat" a
bit today and continue as normal tomorrow!

### 8/27/2020

Had some Ethopian food with friends tonight. Sooooo yummy. Calories were definitely
over but oh well. Can make it up tomorrow

### 8/26/2020

Another chill day. Energy levels felt good, workout felt good. Reading-filled day :)

### 8/25/2020

Chill day. Made eggs again today, so yummy. Makes me think more and more about
being meal-centric. Perhaps I can work towards doing something like eggs in AM,
deli-wrap for lunch, and then proper dinner. It is nice to snack a bit mid day
as a break between work and for re-fueling. But perhaps with more meal-centric
food will have less need to snack

### 8/24/2020

Another day of 2x workouts! Energy felt good for most of day. Home cooking / good
macros makes a difference!

### 8/23/2020

Dinner was delicious. Tried cooking the tomatoes and cucumbers with the chicken
and frozen veggies. Came out wonderful. There's something I really enjoy about
home cooking.

Overall productive day. Lots of reading and 2x workouts (3+ hours total!)

### 8/22/2020

Lower energy day. Tried getting through trevor's workout but was feeling tired.
Likely due to the fasting from previous day + lots of hookah (almost every other
day for the last few weeks now). Will start limiting smoking amount

### 8/21/2020

Fasted for most of the day to make up for excess calories! Had decent energy
throughout the day and even got in two workouts! Was definitely tempted to eat
in the evening but managed to stay strong!

### 8/20/2020

Another big calorie day. Walked/biked all over NYC apartment hunting. Got some
yummy NYC staples. Street food, shake shack, and local gelato, nom nom

### 8/16/2020

Lots of calories today! Had an epic dinner with some friends. Definitely went overboard but oh well, I enjoyed it :)

### 8/15/2020

Action packed day! 7mi bike ride, 10k steps from exploring, and jiu-jitsu in the
evening. Visited my sis and her bf and had lunch and sweets together. Happy to
be keeping calories in check

### 8/12/2020

Noticed I've been snacking more lately and especially eating lots of the chocolate
almonds. Will try to get more meal centric. Trevor had a good suggestion to get
a water jug too -- I think this is a good idea for hitting the 8 cups / water a
day goal.

New feature added too -- now including trend data for weight!

### 8/11/2020

Stayed up a bit late last night so was a bit lower energy. However
finished up Export Health! with Stopa which felt great. Got some Jiu Jitsu in
the evening as well. Calories came in a bit lower today and honestly could
feel it in my workout. I remarked on this yesterday but yea, I want to be
more on top of drinking water. I'm also trying to incoporate more stretching
and new foods recommended by Trevor.

I guess there's a been a lot of new stuff incoporated lately. Hanging with people
more, eating out more often, running outside, training Jiu-Jitsu, stretching. Doing
lots of new things can feel like a chore, so maybe if I'm feeling like it's getting
too annoying I can cut back on something (maybe replace some workouts with stretch + runs?).
Will feel this out.

Overall though solid day, really proud of Export Health!, happy to be doing
Jiu-Jitsu again, and happy to be eating clean.

### 8/10/2020

After a culinary weekend back to some home cooking. Felt nice to home food again.
Noticed I haven't been as good about drinking 8 cups of water last week. Will try
to be on top of this up again -- I really do think the extra water = extra energy

### 8/9/2020

Met up with some friends in the evening and had some yummy dinner!

### 8/8/2020

Today was a full-day hang! Met up with a buddy Jon for some delicious Goergian food
and NYC roaming followed by Jiu-Jitsu and homemade tacos with our buddy Jan. Fun day!

### 8/7/2020

Was working most of day and didn't make time for proper meals so did more snacking. Kept the snacking
though mostly protein/fats related. In the evening went out with friends for Thai food!

### 8/4/2020

2nd day of freedom! Had some K-BBQ w/ friends. Still a bit excess on calories, but
ensured to plan better for going out. Also, first run today, felt amazing

### 8/3/2020

First day of freedom! Got to meet up with some friends and have some street foods!
Calories definitely added up, but wow >20k steps from all the exploring :)

### 8/2/2020

Was a bit lower energy today so caloried up. Was low calories yesterday so balances yet. Excited to go exploring tomorrow!

### 8/1/2020

Made a few tweaks to the site! Added water and weight tracking to entries.
Two weeks ago I also added swiping (left/right) on mobile when previewing
entries and keyboard shortcuts (left/right/esc/x) on desktop.

### 7/19/2020

Today was a travel day and make-up for yesterday's excess!

### 7/18/2020

Another huge calorie day. Was hanging/celebrating with friends. Ate ~2400cals
alone from snacking in the evening. Had I reigned this in, would have been within
calorie targets across the two days

Celebrating is good, but gotta be more on top of excess in these situations!

### 7/17/2020

Mini fast in the evening to prepare for a magic evening!

### 7/15/2020

Ended up fasting almost the entire day to make up for the excess intake the
previous day. Was over-full for most of the day so this was easy to do. Felt
much better after going on a run. Ate a few dates before doing a second workout.
Felt great by end of day. Back to regular eating tomorrow!

### 7/14/2020

Calories were wayyy overboard today.

Had late dinner with friends which resulted in going over 2000 calories target.
Calorie total was only around 2250 though so not a huge amount over initially.
However I ended up "tilting" and going "all out" afterwards. No bueno. Will keep
in mind that just because I went a little over doesn't mean I should tilt.
