After a culinary weekend back to some home cooking. Felt nice to home food again.
Noticed I haven't been as good about drinking 8 cups of water last week. Will try
to be on top of this up again -- I really do think the extra water = extra energy

### 8/9/2020

Met up with some friends in the evening and had some yummy dinner!

### 8/8/2020

Today was a full-day hang! Met up with a buddy Jon for some delicious Goergian food
and NYC roaming followed by Jiu-Jitsu and homemade tacos with our buddy Jan. Fun day!

### 8/7/2020

Was working most of day and didn't make time for proper meals so did more snacking. Kept the snacking
though mostly protein/fats related. In the evening went out with friends for Thai food!

### 8/4/2020

2nd day of freedom! Had some K-BBQ w/ friends. Still a bit excess on calories, but
ensured to plan better for going out. Also, first run today, felt amazing

### 8/3/2020

First day of freedom! Got to meet up with some friends and have some street foods!
Calories definitely added up, but wow >20k steps from all the exploring :)

### 8/2/2020

Was a bit lower energy today so caloried up. Was low calories yesterday so balances yet. Excited to go exploring tomorrow!

### 8/1/2020

Made a few tweaks to the site! Added water and weight tracking to entries.
Two weeks ago I also added swiping (left/right) on mobile when previewing
entries and keyboard shortcuts (left/right/esc/x) on desktop.

### 7/19/2020

Today was a travel day and make-up for yesterday's excess!

### 7/18/2020

Another huge calorie day. Was hanging/celebrating with friends. Ate ~2400cals
alone from snacking in the evening. Had I reigned this in, would have been within
calorie targets across the two days

Celebrating is good, but gotta be more on top of excess in these situations!

### 7/17/2020

Mini fast in the evening to prepare for a magic evening!

### 7/15/2020

Ended up fasting almost the entire day to make up for the excess intake the
previous day. Was over-full for most of the day so this was easy to do. Felt
much better after going on a run. Ate a few dates before doing a second workout.
Felt great by end of day. Back to regular eating tomorrow!

### 7/14/2020

Calories were wayyy overboard today.

Had late dinner with friends which resulted in going over 2000 calories target.
Calorie total was only around 2250 though so not a huge amount over initially.
However I ended up "tilting" and going "all out" afterwards. No bueno. Will keep
in mind that just because I went a little over doesn't mean I should tilt.
