Ended up fasting almost the entire day to make up for the excess intake the
previous day. Was over-full for most of the day so this was easy to do. Felt
much better after going on a run. Ate a few dates before doing a second workout.
Felt great by end of day. Back to regular eating tomorrow!

Calories were wayyy overboard today.

Had late dinner with friends which resulted in going over 2000 calories target.
Calorie total was only around 2250 though so not a huge amount over initially.
However I ended up "tilting" and going "all out" afterwards. No bueno. Will keep
in mind that just because I went a little over doesn't mean I should tilt.
